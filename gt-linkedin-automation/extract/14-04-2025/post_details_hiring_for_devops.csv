Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation.

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools.

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation.

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

If you know someone who is — please share. And if you just want to say hi or swap sourcing tricks — I’d love that too. 🙌

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Alan SandersAlan Sanders,,"🎖 Eagle Scouts: A Legacy of Leadership & ServiceOnly about 6% of Scouts ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout—the highest honor in Scouting. It’s a milestone that represents years of commitment, leadership, service, and personal growth. But the impact of Scouting doesn’t stop at the badge.📚 Academic Success: Studies show that over 80% of Eagle Scouts go on to college, many pursuing advanced degrees in STEM, business, and public service.🇺🇸 Military & Civic Service: A significant number of Eagle Scouts choose to serve their country—many as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces—bringing Scouting values like duty, honor, and preparedness with them.❤️ Community Engagement: Scouts are more likely to volunteer for non-profit organizations throughout their lives, and many go on to lead those organizations. Service becomes not just a project, but a lifelong habit.⚖️ Real Life, Real Outcomes: Even with the best training and mentorship, life is complex. Some youth who participate in Scouting face hardships, and a small number may end up incarcerated. But here's what sets Scouting apart: the program offers second chances, mentors who care, and tools to get back on track.Scouting isn't a guarantee—it’s a foundation. And when we invest in youth, we shape futures. Some will soar higher than we ever imagined. Others may stumble—but they’ll know how to stand back up.hashtag#EagleScout hashtag#ScoutingMatters hashtag#YouthDevelopment hashtag#Leadership hashtag#BSA hashtag#EaglePride hashtag#CommunityService hashtag#MilitaryService hashtag#Education hashtag#SecondChances

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling.

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented. Avoid “selling” too hard — show competence and partnership.Would you like the AI formula?  Comment ""formula"" below.hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviews

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Alan SandersAlan Sanders,,"🎖 Eagle Scouts: A Legacy of Leadership & ServiceOnly about 6% of Scouts ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout—the highest honor in Scouting. It’s a milestone that represents years of commitment, leadership, service, and personal growth. But the impact of Scouting doesn’t stop at the badge.📚 Academic Success: Studies show that over 80% of Eagle Scouts go on to college, many pursuing advanced degrees in STEM, business, and public service.🇺🇸 Military & Civic Service: A significant number of Eagle Scouts choose to serve their country—many as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces—bringing Scouting values like duty, honor, and preparedness with them.❤️ Community Engagement: Scouts are more likely to volunteer for non-profit organizations throughout their lives, and many go on to lead those organizations. Service becomes not just a project, but a lifelong habit.⚖️ Real Life, Real Outcomes: Even with the best training and mentorship, life is complex. Some youth who participate in Scouting face hardships, and a small number may end up incarcerated. But here's what sets Scouting apart: the program offers second chances, mentors who care, and tools to get back on track.Scouting isn't a guarantee—it’s a foundation. And when we invest in youth, we shape futures. Some will soar higher than we ever imagined. Others may stumble—but they’ll know how to stand back up.hashtag#EagleScout hashtag#ScoutingMatters hashtag#YouthDevelopment hashtag#Leadership hashtag#BSA hashtag#EaglePride hashtag#CommunityService hashtag#MilitaryService hashtag#Education hashtag#SecondChances

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools.

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Alan SandersAlan Sanders,,"🎖 Eagle Scouts: A Legacy of Leadership & ServiceOnly about 6% of Scouts ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout—the highest honor in Scouting. It’s a milestone that represents years of commitment, leadership, service, and personal growth. But the impact of Scouting doesn’t stop at the badge.📚 Academic Success: Studies show that over 80% of Eagle Scouts go on to college, many pursuing advanced degrees in STEM, business, and public service.🇺🇸 Military & Civic Service: A significant number of Eagle Scouts choose to serve their country—many as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces—bringing Scouting values like duty, honor, and preparedness with them.❤️ Community Engagement: Scouts are more likely to volunteer for non-profit organizations throughout their lives, and many go on to lead those organizations. Service becomes not just a project, but a lifelong habit.⚖️ Real Life, Real Outcomes: Even with the best training and mentorship, life is complex. Some youth who participate in Scouting face hardships, and a small number may end up incarcerated. But here's what sets Scouting apart: the program offers second chances, mentors who care, and tools to get back on track.Scouting isn't a guarantee—it’s a foundation. And when we invest in youth, we shape futures. Some will soar higher than we ever imagined. Others may stumble—but they’ll know how to stand back up.hashtag#EagleScout hashtag#ScoutingMatters hashtag#YouthDevelopment hashtag#Leadership hashtag#BSA hashtag#EaglePride hashtag#CommunityService hashtag#MilitaryService hashtag#Education hashtag#SecondChances

Aishwarya PrakashAishwarya Prakash,,"Recruitment in 2025: Where Ghosts, Unicorns & Infinite Offers Roam Being a recruiter in today's job market,especially in India is like starring in your own suspense thriller. You know the characters (candidates), you think you know the plot (job role), but you're never quite sure how it’s going to end (if they’ll join).Here are a few “fun” challenges we’re all too familiar with these days:1. The Great No-Show Mystery 🏃‍♂️ Candidate confirms the offer, shares documents, talks about their ""dream role"" and then? Disappears into thin air. Poof! We’re left wondering if they ever existed.2. The 100% Hike Olympics 💸 “Current CTC is 12 LPA, expected is 24 LPA.”Because apparently, inflation hits different when you're switching jobs. Budget? What's that?3. Multi-Offer Juggling Act 🎭 In today’s market, every good candidate has 3-4 offers. And they’ll ""get back to you"" once they’ve consulted their astrologer, cat, and coffee mug.4. The Myth of the Immediate Joiner 🧘‍♀️Oh yes, I’m available to join immediately, until you realize “immediate” actually means “after my cousin’s wedding and a 45-day notice period.”5. The Resume vs. Reality Show 📄 Resume: AWS expert, Node.js ninja, team leader.Interview: Can’t explain basic concepts. Still waiting for Google to help mid-answer.6. Is This Role Remote? 🏡If the job isn’t remote or hybrid, you’ve already lost half the candidate pool. In 2025, coming to office is apparently a lifestyle choice, not a job requirement.7. Assessment Round: Eternal EditionYou send a simple test. “Will submit it tonight.” It’s been 6 business nights and counting...At Astria Digital , we’re mastering the art of navigating this chaos with patience, a sense of humor, and a lot of coffee. ☕To all fellow recruiters out there, you're not alone. Keep sourcing, keep smiling. Let’s celebrate every closure like it's a festival (because, honestly, it is). 🎉hashtag#HRRecruitment hashtag#HRNightmares hashtag#Recruitmentstruggles hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#HiringHumor hashtag#IndianJobMarket hashtag#RecruitmentWoes hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#AstriaDigital hashtag#TalentTales hashtag#WorkWithHeart

Garvit PatelGarvit Patel,,"From Legacy to Modern DevSecOps: How GitLab Helped Us Transform CI/CD at Scale 🚀As technology leaders, we often face the challenge of maintaining speed, reliability, and security while managing growing complexity. At our organization, this challenge became increasingly evident as we scaled—managing 350+ repositories, 500+ pipelines, and generating over 1 million artifacts using a combination of Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Nexus.It worked—until it didn’t.Our legacy toolchain became a bottleneck. Fragmented systems meant siloed workflows, rising maintenance overhead, and growing security blind spots. We needed an alternative that could not only replace but also modernize our CI/CD ecosystem.That’s where GitLab came in.🛠️ One Platform, One VisionGitLab offered a unified DevSecOps platform that checked every box—pipeline orchestration, SCM, artifact storage, and security scanning—all under one roof. This consolidation allowed us to:* Migrate hundreds of repositories and thousands of pipeline jobs efficiently* Replace legacy CI/CD scripts with modular, reusable GitLab CI templates* Manage artifact lifecycle and retention more intelligently* Streamline developer workflows and reduce cognitive load🔄 The TransformationWith GitLab, we’ve:* Rebuilt 500+ CI/CD pipelines from scratch using scalable templates* Unified version control and pipeline execution into a single tool* Integrated GitLab Container Registry and eliminated the need for a separate artifact repository* Embedded SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and license checks directly into the pipelinesThe result? Faster delivery, improved collaboration, and reduced operational friction.🔐 Security as a First-Class CitizenSecurity was another key driver. GitLab’s native security capabilities meant we didn’t have to stitch together multiple tools. Now, every commit and merge request is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities—shifting security left and giving our developers instant feedback.📊 The Outcome⏱️ Reduced pipeline execution time and overhead🔍 Full traceability from code to production🔐 Proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation📉 Lowered operational and licensing costs💡 Empowered teams with self-service pipelines and visibilityA Future-Proof CI/CD Strategy:Our move to GitLab wasn’t just a migration—it was a reinvention. By modernizing our CI/CD infrastructure, we’ve laid the foundation for agility, security, and scale in the years ahead.If your organization is struggling with outdated DevOps tooling or rising complexity, I highly recommend evaluating GitLab. It's been a game-changer for us.Big kudos to the DevOps team for driving this transformation—special thanks to Dixit Hihoriya for his outstanding technical expertise.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#GitLab hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#Modernization hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#GitlabDuo

"🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸🎸Geoff Koboldt, MBA 🎸",,"Crush Your Next Interview: 3 Proven Prep Strategies That WorkI. Analyze the interviewer in advance by copying 10 posts from LinkedIn and pasting into 'intelligence' (chatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to decipher their personality.II. Analyze how to build rapport with them.  Again, utilize 'intelligence' combined with your own intellectual know-how.III. Analyze the job description, your resume, and the analysis from above along with 3 of your best challenge/action/result stories.  Use 'intelligence' to assist you but craft undeniable stories from your authentic voice.  These stories/scripts should be less than 2 minutes long and succinct in delivery. Bonus:  Record your interview scripts.  Play them back listening to audio only (no video), video (no audio), and finally review the transcript and identify all words that don't add any value. Here's an example we used for one of my clients recently who had 2 interviews for a role.Jane Doe — Product & Engineering Leader, Data-Driven, Reserved CommunicatorJane's focus:➤ She leads Digital Payments Product and is embedded in UX/UI, product lifecycle, dashboards, and API integration.➤ She values cross-functional product thinking, end-to-end delivery, and data-backed execution.➤ She’s product-centric, with strong roots in DevOps, design thinking, microservices, and product analytics.What she is likely assessing:➤ How you enable predictable, high-quality delivery of Product features.➤ Your partnership model with Product teams, especially when building dashboards and reporting pipelines.➤ How you ensure product teams are “working on the right things.”How to prepare:➤ Come ready with 1–2 examples of launching product features where he partnered with product managers and UX teams, particularly if dashboards/reporting/analytics were involved.➤ Be able to speak to how he drives agile hygiene, data cleanliness, sprint scope and delivery.➤ Reinforce ownership mindset...not just delivery of what’s asked, but questioning and shaping what gets prioritized.Strong phrases to use:➤ “We built joint dashboards across product and tech to track scope completion and backlog health.”➤ “One thing I emphasize is product telemetry and using feedback loops early.”Personality Signals:➤ Doesn’t post much on LinkedIn beyond hiring... suggests she’s focused, introverted, or time-sensitive.➤ Has a strong technical foundation (APIs, AWS, CI/CD, design thinking) and delivery mindset.Rapport Strategy:Break the ice with a mutual appreciation for product/tech collaboration.Ex: “I noticed your background spans both product and engineering... I’ve always found that’s where the magic happens. That kind of dual lens really resonates with how I like to work.”Tone: Low-key, prepared, outcome-oriented.

Sutirth ChakravartySutirth Chakravarty,,"Circa early 2024.I had the chance to attend several observability meetups, and one talk that truly stuck with me was by Prathamesh Sonpatki. To quote their CEO, Nishant Modak—“Observability is a three-body problem: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.” 😛As a mobile engineer, I’ve always found observability in mobile to be… tricky. Different API versions, a vast range of devices, performance bottlenecks—it’s a hard nut to crack.That’s when I stumbled upon measure.sh—and I was blown away. I connected with the team via their Discord, and a massive shoutout to the awesome folks: Gandharva Kumar,  Debjeet,  Anup Cowkur & Abhay Sood. You all are building something truly special.Excited, I pitched it to our CTO, Prajakt Deolasee, who’s a big advocate of open source and experimentation. With his green signal, I got measure.sh integrated within a day. Also, big thanks to our head of DevOps, Mohamedji Bardolia, for spinning up the dashboard instantly. (P.S. We’re hiring DevOps folks—ping him if you're interested! Turtlemint)What changed for us?🚀 Crash-free sessions improved dramatically—now hitting a mythical 99.99% consistently 📊 Logs, metrics, traces—finally stitched together in one view ⚡️ Our hot & warm app startup times? Looking great!A few weeks back, I was invited to share this journey—thank you, Technogise for hosting the event, and to Rajesh Hadiya & Gaurav Thakkar for the invite. 🙌Special thanks to my mentor, Vedang Manerikar, for always pushing me forward (and for not letting me give up on software engineering just yet 😛).Youtube Video: https://lnkd.in/gb3XAR4A

Alan SandersAlan Sanders,,"🎖 Eagle Scouts: A Legacy of Leadership & ServiceOnly about 6% of Scouts ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout—the highest honor in Scouting. It’s a milestone that represents years of commitment, leadership, service, and personal growth. But the impact of Scouting doesn’t stop at the badge.📚 Academic Success: Studies show that over 80% of Eagle Scouts go on to college, many pursuing advanced degrees in STEM, business, and public service.🇺🇸 Military & Civic Service: A significant number of Eagle Scouts choose to serve their country—many as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces—bringing Scouting values like duty, honor, and preparedness with them.❤️ Community Engagement: Scouts are more likely to volunteer for non-profit organizations throughout their lives, and many go on to lead those organizations. Service becomes not just a project, but a lifelong habit.⚖️ Real Life, Real Outcomes: Even with the best training and mentorship, life is complex. Some youth who participate in Scouting face hardships, and a small number may end up incarcerated. But here's what sets Scouting apart: the program offers second chances, mentors who care, and tools to get back on track.Scouting isn't a guarantee—it’s a foundation. And when we invest in youth, we shape futures. Some will soar higher than we ever imagined. Others may stumble—but they’ll know how to stand back up.hashtag#EagleScout hashtag#ScoutingMatters hashtag#YouthDevelopment hashtag#Leadership hashtag#BSA hashtag#EaglePride hashtag#CommunityService hashtag#MilitaryService hashtag#Education hashtag#SecondChances
