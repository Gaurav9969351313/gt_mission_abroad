Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

MANIKANTA Yaswanth kumarMANIKANTA Yaswanth kumar,,"Day:-8 Learning selenium with java (Automation)✅""Before diving into Selenium with Java, it's important to have a good understanding of Core Java topics.""🌟 What is Exception Handling?Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

MANIKANTA Yaswanth kumarMANIKANTA Yaswanth kumar,,"Day:-8 Learning selenium with java (Automation)✅""Before diving into Selenium with Java, it's important to have a good understanding of Core Java topics.""🌟 What is Exception Handling?Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

MANIKANTA Yaswanth kumarMANIKANTA Yaswanth kumar,,"Day:-8 Learning selenium with java (Automation)✅""Before diving into Selenium with Java, it's important to have a good understanding of Core Java topics.""🌟 What is Exception Handling?Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions.

MANIKANTA Yaswanth kumarMANIKANTA Yaswanth kumar,,"Day:-8 Learning selenium with java (Automation)✅""Before diving into Selenium with Java, it's important to have a good understanding of Core Java topics.""🌟 What is Exception Handling?Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning
