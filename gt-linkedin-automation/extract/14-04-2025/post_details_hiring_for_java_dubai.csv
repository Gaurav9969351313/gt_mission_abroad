This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

Maria Nikonova (Andreeva)Maria Nikonova (Andreeva),,"The UAE Ministry of Finance has issued Cabinet Decision No. 84 of 2025, which provides further clarification on the requirements for preparing audited financial statements under the Corporate Tax Law. This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Maria Nikonova (Andreeva)Maria Nikonova (Andreeva),,"The UAE Ministry of Finance has issued Cabinet Decision No. 84 of 2025, which provides further clarification on the requirements for preparing audited financial statements under the Corporate Tax Law. This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Below is some of the most crucial information you should know if you're looking to rent a property or if your property is on the market for rent.- Subletting in Dubai requires written permission from the landlord.- Tenants must get landlord approval and follow legal procedures before subletting to avoid eviction or disputes.- Unauthorised subletting is a breach of the tenancy contract and can lead to legal action.- Landlords can file a case at the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre if subletting is discovered.- Ejari registration doesn’t protect subtenants unless the subletting is officially approved.Make sure you get professional assistance to make sure you get the best deal in Dubai in the most safe and transparent transfer.Read more: https://lnkd.in/gGEf6Whbhashtag#Dubai hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#Rental hashtag#PropertyMarket

Maria Nikonova (Andreeva)Maria Nikonova (Andreeva),,"The UAE Ministry of Finance has issued Cabinet Decision No. 84 of 2025, which provides further clarification on the requirements for preparing audited financial statements under the Corporate Tax Law. This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Below is some of the most crucial information you should know if you're looking to rent a property or if your property is on the market for rent.- Subletting in Dubai requires written permission from the landlord.- Tenants must get landlord approval and follow legal procedures before subletting to avoid eviction or disputes.- Unauthorised subletting is a breach of the tenancy contract and can lead to legal action.- Landlords can file a case at the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre if subletting is discovered.- Ejari registration doesn’t protect subtenants unless the subletting is officially approved.Make sure you get professional assistance to make sure you get the best deal in Dubai in the most safe and transparent transfer.Read more: https://lnkd.in/gGEf6Whbhashtag#Dubai hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#Rental hashtag#PropertyMarket

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast. The winners will be those who adapt, diversify, and build resilient, future-ready supply chains.hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#China hashtag#SupplyChainStrategy hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ADIG

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

This new decision replaces Cabinet Decision No. 82 of 2023 and will apply to tax periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.https://lnkd.in/g6Gawn3J A key update introduced by the new decision is that Tax Groups are now obligated to prepare and maintain special purpose audited financial statements in line with the format, procedures, and rules prescribed by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).Notably, Clause 3 of Article 2 introduces an unexpected and intriguing provision: Qualifying Free Zone Persons engaged in the distribution of goods or materials in or from a Designated Zone, in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 265 of 2023, must comply with any additional procedures set by the FTA. The inclusion of this clause - within a decision focused primarily on financial statement requirements - hints that the FTA may be preparing to issue specific compliance obligations targeting Designated Zone distributors.hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#TaxAdvisory hashtag#QFZP

Hatem BelkhoujaHatem Belkhouja,,"A New Era for Global Trade?The U.S. tariff crisis isn't just disrupting markets — it's creating a unique opportunity for China to step up as the world’s go-to partner for multilateralism and free trade.At the Annual Investment Meeting Congress in Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Aweidha, CEO of Abu Dhabi Investment Group (ADIG), shared bold insights:""This isn't just about tariffs. It's about reshaping the global trade order to favor U.S. interests,"" he said. As panic hit markets and trillions in investor wealth evaporated, Mr. bin Aweidha pointed to China’s strategic advantage — and the Middle East’s crucial role.With the UAE boasting the highest number of sovereign wealth funds globally, new partnerships between China and the region could be key to navigating the storm.""This might be the worst crisis yet — and recovery could take 5 to 10 years,"" he warned. ""You can't concentrate global wealth in one place without shaking the entire system.""Global leaders are sounding the alarm too. The OECD predicts global GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025, and warns that rising trade barriers could fuel inflation.Sean Doherty from the World Economic Forum called tariffs ""an inefficient tool"" that only adds uncertainty. His advice? Companies need to diversify fast — and look toward Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for new opportunities.The takeaway: Global trade is evolving fast.

Dean JamesDean James,,"""Navigating the Storm: UAE Companies Innovate Amid US Tariff Pressures""While US tariffs present challenges, they also offer some potential benefits for companies in the UAE. One significant advantage is the increased demand for UAE products. With US tariffs making American products more expensive, global buyers may look for alternative suppliers. This opens up opportunities for UAE companies to capture new markets and increase their exports. Additionally, UAE businesses can leverage their strategic location and robust infrastructure to offer competitive pricing and faster delivery times compared to US suppliers.The tariffs also encourage UAE companies to strengthen regional trade. By boosting intra-regional trade, UAE businesses can enhance economic cooperation within the Middle East and with other regions less affected by US tariffs. The UAE's numerous free trade zones provide an attractive environment for businesses to operate with reduced tariffs and customs duties. Companies can use these zones to re-export goods to other markets, potentially bypassing US tariffs.Innovation and efficiency are other areas where UAE businesses can benefit. To remain competitive, companies are investing in new technologies and processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This includes adopting digital technologies and enhancing supply chain management. Additionally, businesses are focusing on sustainability to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their reputation. This includes sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers and improving energy efficiency.The UAE's favorable business environment also attracts foreign investment. The uncertainty and high tariffs in the US are causing property investors to reduce their investments there, making UAE real estate more attractive to overseas investors. This can lead to increased demand and higher property values in the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE's business-friendly policies, such as long-term visas and relaxed ownership laws, make it an appealing destination for foreign investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Strategic adjustments by UAE businesses can also mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Companies can export goods to the UAE, which can then be re-exported to the US, potentially avoiding the new US tariffs. The UAE's free zones facilitate this process. Additionally, businesses can assemble or manufacture goods in the UAE using imported components from other countries, helping them avoid higher tariffs on finished products.In conclusion, while US tariffs pose challenges, they also create opportunities for UAE businesses to innovate, diversify, and attract foreign investment. By leveraging their strategic location, investing in technology, and adopting sustainable practices, UAE companies can navigate the uncertainties of the current economic landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Below is some of the most crucial information you should know if you're looking to rent a property or if your property is on the market for rent.- Subletting in Dubai requires written permission from the landlord.- Tenants must get landlord approval and follow legal procedures before subletting to avoid eviction or disputes.- Unauthorised subletting is a breach of the tenancy contract and can lead to legal action.- Landlords can file a case at the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre if subletting is discovered.- Ejari registration doesn’t protect subtenants unless the subletting is officially approved.Make sure you get professional assistance to make sure you get the best deal in Dubai in the most safe and transparent transfer.Read more: https://lnkd.in/gGEf6Whbhashtag#Dubai hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#Rental hashtag#PropertyMarket
