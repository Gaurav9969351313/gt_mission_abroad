RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

RICHARD WILLIAMRICHARD WILLIAM,,"The Key Strategy For Providing Effective Feedback In Remote Work Settings Is:Scheduling regular video calls check-ins for feedback.Why?Regular video calls allow for real-time, clear, and more personal communication. They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

James EganJames Egan,call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com,"Oliver Bernard Salary Benchmark - April 2025/JVM Market updatePlease see below our latest benchmark, for April 2025. Within the space I mainly focus on (Java/Kotlin) we have seen a positive uptick in roles in the past six months, which is a promising sign. A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com

They help reduce misunderstandings, allow for tone and body language to be observed, and create space for dialogue. This builds trust and ensures the feedback is received constructively.The other methods can support the process:Detailed emails are useful for documenting feedback and giving time to process.Instant messaging is good for quick, informal notes but not ideal for nuanced feedback.

Jan KhodabakshJan Khodabaksh,,"Almost zero marketing budget? Did I hear that right? Now that I think about it, you don’t see many billboards or magazine ads for Arista.Yet it’s right up there competing with the best, if not leading. So, what are some of the key differentiators (in my opinion)? A unified software platform. It might not sound groundbreaking, but for operators and system admins, it makes a world of difference. I personally think it reflects on the engineering culture that underpins Arista’s strategy. Take SysDB, think of it as a dynamic, distributed data lake on every Arista platform. It keeps internal systems in sync, while allowing them to operate independently and respond intelligently in real time. Then there’s the fully automated 24/7 testing. Every feature, every function constantly tested. This means full regression testing for every maintenance release or bugfix, which likely explains the low volume of Arista CVEs. Arista takes a steady, robust development approach with no gimmicks, no rushed features just to tick boxes. And yet they still manage to innovate ahead of the pack. I remember back in 2014, whilst I was doing some product testing, the Arista Networks not only outperformed, the 7150 was the only product offering hardware multicast and unicast NAT. If I remember correctly, it was the only platform with a dedicated oscillator for precision timing. They were the new kid on the block but already perfectly aligned with their target audience. So, here’s my small thank you. I created a billboard poster for your advertising campaign. @AristaMarketing – feel free to use it. hashtag#Arista hashtag#AristaNetworks

A quick overview of what I am seeing within the JVM market in the past 3 months:- Candidates now have multiple interviews + offers to choose from, compared to 6 months ago when candidates would only have 1/2 interviews on the go. - Kotlin is still very much in demand across our client's, with the demand for Scala unfortunately dropping (From speaking to CTO's/VP of Engineering, this is mainly down to cost) - We are slowly moving away from it being a ""buyer's market"" for clients, where they have been able to be very picky on candidate's they hire, due to how many candidates have been active on the market. - In term's of technology stack' in demand, the below skills are the most popular across our clients in the JVM space at present: Java/Kotlin, Docker/Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TDD/BDD. - Contract market? We have spoken to hundred's of candidates about this recently and rates have dropped slightly (This is mainly due to how many candidates have been available), but there is still certain sectors that are hiring contractors for their projects. - WFH/Remote? Around 80-90% of our clients are now between 1-3 days a week in the office.If you have any questions about the JVM market, in terms of hiring/looking for a new position, please reach out and we can arrange a call..james.egan@oliverbernard.com
