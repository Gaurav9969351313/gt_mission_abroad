Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?üìä At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ‚û°Ô∏è Did this time double during Ramadan? ‚û°Ô∏è Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same‚Äîat best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.üßë‚Äçüíª Work hours are reduced, yes‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt disappear üçΩÔ∏è The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits üõçÔ∏è The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions üïå And of course, there‚Äôs spiritual practice‚Äîwhich is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?üé¨ It‚Äôs a content marathon with no finish line, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for‚Äîand at what cost?üí∞ How did these productions even work financially? üìâ And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?üìä At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ‚û°Ô∏è Did this time double during Ramadan? ‚û°Ô∏è Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same‚Äîat best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.üßë‚Äçüíª Work hours are reduced, yes‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt disappear üçΩÔ∏è The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits üõçÔ∏è The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions üïå And of course, there‚Äôs spiritual practice‚Äîwhich is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?üé¨ It‚Äôs a content marathon with no finish line, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for‚Äîand at what cost?üí∞ How did these productions even work financially? üìâ And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?üìä At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ‚û°Ô∏è Did this time double during Ramadan? ‚û°Ô∏è Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same‚Äîat best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.üßë‚Äçüíª Work hours are reduced, yes‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt disappear üçΩÔ∏è The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits üõçÔ∏è The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions üïå And of course, there‚Äôs spiritual practice‚Äîwhich is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?üé¨ It‚Äôs a content marathon with no finish line, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for‚Äîand at what cost?üí∞ How did these productions even work financially? üìâ And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path.

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Fabiana Scupino RibeiroFabiana Scupino Ribeiro,,"Experiences that Inspire and Broaden HorizonsAfter completing the online phase of the Innovation Program, I traveled to Israel and Dubai in August/2023. Here are the most impactful moments.üáÆüá± Israel: A Sequence of Wow Moments üîπ Technology & PurposeWe visited companies that showed how technology can truly drive transformation ‚Äî two stood out for their creativity and impact:‚û° Facetrom : using facial biometrics to help unbanked individuals access credit by predicting default risk.‚û° Watergen Ltd: creating clean drinking water from air humidity‚ú® Can you imagine how many social and economic barriers can be overcome when people gain access to basic resources like credit and clean water?üîπ Education, Science & Sustainability‚û°Weizmann Institute of Science: a global leader in cutting-edge research on cancer, AI, and biomedicine.‚û°Kibbutz Hatzerim and Netafim: desert agriculture reinvented through scalable, sustainable solutions ‚Äî including raising fish in the desert, using brackish water, to grow jojoba and other crops.‚û° Peres Center for Peace and Innovation: a powerful intersection of education, technology, and social impact ‚Äî including an immersive 3D experience of the future.üîπ People at the Center of EverythingOne of the most powerful moments was a talk by Golan Vach, who said: ‚û° ‚ÄúWhat makes the difference is the extra mile.‚Äù ‚û° ‚ÄúPeople are always the difference.‚Äù These words captured a key insight from this journey: innovation only becomes real when driven by passionate, purpose-driven people.üîπ Culture That InspiresExperiencing the Shabbat, walking the Via Dolorosa, visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, feeling the energy of the Western Wall, sleeping in the desert, being welcomed into a Bedouin tent, and visiting Yad Vashem ‚Äî I came to understand that the strength of a culture lies in its people.üá¶üá™ Dubai: Where Tradition Meets Bold Vision üîπ Living Culture on Every CornerBy walking the streets, listening to locals, and exploring markets and mosques, I gained a meaningful glimpse into a rich and inspiring culture.üîπ A Window into the FutureThe Museum of the Future in Dubai was a standout moment ‚Äî a bold vision of the world in 2071.‚ÄãWhat struck me most was how Dubai and Israel, though different in approach, are aligned on global key challengers ‚Äî such as shifting to plant-based food and improving waste management.Both the Museum of the Future and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation inspire us to shape a better world by combining vision with real solutions. Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning. In 2024, I started an MBA in AI & Big Data at USP to deepen my purpose-driven path. More reflections coming soon!üöÄhashtag#innovation hashtag#transformation hashtag#future hashtag#career hashtag#purpose hashtag#technology hashtag#realexperiences hashtag#sabbaticalyear hashtag#learning hashtag#lifeinmotion hashtag#AI hashtag#BigData

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists‚Äã, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side‚Äã, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ‚ÄãPresident T‚Äãrump's expected visit to the region in May).‚ÄãWhile volatility ‚Äãexists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:‚Äã https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Different approaches, yet deeply complementary ‚Äî a clear sign that some challenges can only be solved through global collaboration.-----This incredible journey was just the beginning.
