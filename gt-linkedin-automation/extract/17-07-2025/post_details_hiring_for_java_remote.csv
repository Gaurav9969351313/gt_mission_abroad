Use a senior business analyst and a team of business analysts to document how your business works into BRD, and FRD. (Business Requirements Documentation, and Functional Requirements Documentation)In the BRD also specifically document your competitive edge, how you stay in business, and innovate. How are you different from or better than your competitors?Specifically document how you collect and use intelligence internally and on your competitors. You need a full competitor intelligence database in addition to internal BI.Also, in the BRD, document legal compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.2. Sign-off and deliver the BRD to me, the enterprise data modeler. I’ll make a data model structure that makes your data compatible with modern software, ERP, BI, AI, and automatically follow how your business works. I’ll create data view GUI, insert GUI for data entry, data update GUI, etc.3. The last step is I and an ETL analyst will Create a repeatable ETL process to extract, transform, and load your data. The data model will automatically import and fix data that can be fixed. Bad data will be quarantined for manual data entry repair.AT THIS POINT YOUR DATA IS FIXED, ERP, BI, and AI ready! Response: “So just formally document everything and hand it to you? That’s it?!”“Yes, that’s it,” I responded. “WELL Why haven’t we already done this?” The President asked the CIO.“Cost!” The CEO interjected.“Cost? What are we looking at?” The President asked.“We got three other estimates 8 years ago.” The CIO resumed. “$6 billion from Xerox, $1 Billion from PWC and IBM, and $2,000,000 from the offshore guys we usually use.”Awkward silence for 4 second…“So what the F happened?” The President asked.The CIO slowly responded, “We took the most cost effective option…”“And went over it by over $100 million,” the CEO interjected. “Well we under estimated the analysis requirements, got to the end of the project, and nothing worked,” the CIO finished.“And the data and performance got ten times worse!” The CEO said.“Well what about that automatic data model thing?!” The predident asked.“We didn’t get that,” the CIO explained. “The cost of just that would have added two or three years and about $3 BILLION to the project according to our analysts.”“As opposed to 8 years, $100 million in project costs, and $48 BILLION in revenue waste,” the CEO interjected. “All before my time, I might add.”Awkward silence, papers rustling…“Where are we bleeding the most money?” the President asked.“Supply chain,” both CEO and CIO answered in unison.“Second and Third?”“Data breaches and legal,” they answered in unison.Awkward silence…“Meet back in 48 hours.”Disconnect beeps…

Hanabal KhaingHanabal Khaing,,"$3 BILLION dollar question from a desperate CIO of a fortune 500 company with the CEO and founder/President on the call - “In the simplest terms, tell me HOW to fix my data so that everything FIRST works, SECONDLY works in real-time; BI, ERP, and AI?”1. Use a senior business analyst and a team of business analysts to document how your business works into BRD, and FRD. (Business Requirements Documentation, and Functional Requirements Documentation)In the BRD also specifically document your competitive edge, how you stay in business, and innovate. How are you different from or better than your competitors?Specifically document how you collect and use intelligence internally and on your competitors. You need a full competitor intelligence database in addition to internal BI.Also, in the BRD, document legal compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.2. Sign-off and deliver the BRD to me, the enterprise data modeler. I’ll make a data model structure that makes your data compatible with modern software, ERP, BI, AI, and automatically follow how your business works. I’ll create data view GUI, insert GUI for data entry, data update GUI, etc.3. The last step is I and an ETL analyst will Create a repeatable ETL process to extract, transform, and load your data. The data model will automatically import and fix data that can be fixed. Bad data will be quarantined for manual data entry repair.AT THIS POINT YOUR DATA IS FIXED, ERP, BI, and AI ready! Response: “So just formally document everything and hand it to you? That’s it?!”“Yes, that’s it,” I responded. “WELL Why haven’t we already done this?” The President asked the CIO.“Cost!” The CEO interjected.“Cost? What are we looking at?” The President asked.“We got three other estimates 8 years ago.” The CIO resumed. “$6 billion from Xerox, $1 Billion from PWC and IBM, and $2,000,000 from the offshore guys we usually use.”Awkward silence for 4 second…“So what the F happened?” The President asked.The CIO slowly responded, “We took the most cost effective option…”“And went over it by over $100 million,” the CEO interjected. “Well we under estimated the analysis requirements, got to the end of the project, and nothing worked,” the CIO finished.“And the data and performance got ten times worse!” The CEO said.“Well what about that automatic data model thing?!” The predident asked.“We didn’t get that,” the CIO explained. “The cost of just that would have added two or three years and about $3 BILLION to the project according to our analysts.”“As opposed to 8 years, $100 million in project costs, and $48 BILLION in revenue waste,” the CEO interjected. “All before my time, I might add.”Awkward silence, papers rustling…“Where are we bleeding the most money?” the President asked.“Supply chain,” both CEO and CIO answered in unison.“Second and Third?”“Data breaches and legal,” they answered in unison.Awkward silence…“Meet back in 48 hours.”Disconnect beeps…

Hanabal KhaingHanabal Khaing,,"$3 BILLION dollar question from a desperate CIO of a fortune 500 company with the CEO and founder/President on the call - “In the simplest terms, tell me HOW to fix my data so that everything FIRST works, SECONDLY works in real-time; BI, ERP, and AI?”1. Use a senior business analyst and a team of business analysts to document how your business works into BRD, and FRD. (Business Requirements Documentation, and Functional Requirements Documentation)In the BRD also specifically document your competitive edge, how you stay in business, and innovate. How are you different from or better than your competitors?Specifically document how you collect and use intelligence internally and on your competitors. You need a full competitor intelligence database in addition to internal BI.Also, in the BRD, document legal compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.2. Sign-off and deliver the BRD to me, the enterprise data modeler. I’ll make a data model structure that makes your data compatible with modern software, ERP, BI, AI, and automatically follow how your business works. I’ll create data view GUI, insert GUI for data entry, data update GUI, etc.3. The last step is I and an ETL analyst will Create a repeatable ETL process to extract, transform, and load your data. The data model will automatically import and fix data that can be fixed. Bad data will be quarantined for manual data entry repair.AT THIS POINT YOUR DATA IS FIXED, ERP, BI, and AI ready! Response: “So just formally document everything and hand it to you? That’s it?!”“Yes, that’s it,” I responded. “WELL Why haven’t we already done this?” The President asked the CIO.“Cost!” The CEO interjected.“Cost?

Use a senior business analyst and a team of business analysts to document how your business works into BRD, and FRD. (Business Requirements Documentation, and Functional Requirements Documentation)In the BRD also specifically document your competitive edge, how you stay in business, and innovate. How are you different from or better than your competitors?Specifically document how you collect and use intelligence internally and on your competitors. You need a full competitor intelligence database in addition to internal BI.Also, in the BRD, document legal compliance and regulatory reporting requirements.2. Sign-off and deliver the BRD to me, the enterprise data modeler. I’ll make a data model structure that makes your data compatible with modern software, ERP, BI, AI, and automatically follow how your business works. I’ll create data view GUI, insert GUI for data entry, data update GUI, etc.3. The last step is I and an ETL analyst will Create a repeatable ETL process to extract, transform, and load your data. The data model will automatically import and fix data that can be fixed. Bad data will be quarantined for manual data entry repair.AT THIS POINT YOUR DATA IS FIXED, ERP, BI, and AI ready! Response: “So just formally document everything and hand it to you? That’s it?!”“Yes, that’s it,” I responded. “WELL Why haven’t we already done this?” The President asked the CIO.“Cost!” The CEO interjected.“Cost? What are we looking at?” The President asked.“We got three other estimates 8 years ago.” The CIO resumed. “$6 billion from Xerox, $1 Billion from PWC and IBM, and $2,000,000 from the offshore guys we usually use.”Awkward silence for 4 second…“So what the F happened?” The President asked.The CIO slowly responded, “We took the most cost effective option…”“And went over it by over $100 million,” the CEO interjected. “Well we under estimated the analysis requirements, got to the end of the project, and nothing worked,” the CIO finished.“And the data and performance got ten times worse!” The CEO said.“Well what about that automatic data model thing?!” The predident asked.“We didn’t get that,” the CIO explained. “The cost of just that would have added two or three years and about $3 BILLION to the project according to our analysts.”“As opposed to 8 years, $100 million in project costs, and $48 BILLION in revenue waste,” the CEO interjected. “All before my time, I might add.”Awkward silence, papers rustling…“Where are we bleeding the most money?” the President asked.“Supply chain,” both CEO and CIO answered in unison.“Second and Third?”“Data breaches and legal,” they answered in unison.Awkward silence…“Meet back in 48 hours.”Disconnect beeps…
