Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information.

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level.

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level.

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training?

𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training? Are we focusing on the right skills? hashtag#AITraining hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#DataScience hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#Algorithms hashtag#CareerGrowth

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training?

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training? Are we focusing on the right skills? hashtag#AITraining hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#DataScience hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#Algorithms hashtag#CareerGrowth

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training?

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training?

Xuan Xuan LimXuan Xuan Lim,,"As a tech recruiter, I read hundreds of CVs each week, and I know how much effort goes into each one. The good news? Sometimes just a few simple tweaks can make a big difference! 🙌Here are some practical tips to help your CV stand out and increase your chances of getting that callback:𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁 You don’t need a fancy template. Stick to clean, minimal formatting, it’s easier to read and keeps the focus on your experience.Use reverse chronological order (most recent role first), and make sure everything is aligned and consistently spaced.𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄Having a skills section is definitely useful, but it’s even more impactful when you show how those tools were used in real projects and what you actually delivered:E.g. Instead of just writing:“Python, AWS, Kubernetes”Try:“Built a real-time trading dashboard using Python and WebSocket APIs, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes to handle high-frequency market data updates.”𝟯. 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲Recruiters and Hiring Managers are often curious about the kind of platforms you've worked on.Was it a trading system? An internal dev tool? A high-traffic app?Wherever possible, include any scale, performance, or impact metrics like:“Reduced latency by 40%”, “processed 10M+ requests/month”𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗩 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻If you’re applying for a specific role, adjusting your CV slightly to highlight relevant skills and projects can really help your profile stand out.𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Instead of putting all your projects in a separate section, group them under the role or company where you did the work.It makes your timeline clearer and your contributions easier to follow.𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀Don’t forget to add your email and phone number. It sounds basic, but I still see CVs with no contact information. Having this makes it easier for recruiters to reach out. 𝟳. 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲Don’t worry about cramming everything into a single page. Focus on depth > fluff. If you’ve worked on impactful projects, give them the space they deserve! For mid to senior-level engineers, 2-3 pages are perfectly normal. Just focus on what matters most and try to keep it clear and concise.𝟴. 𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲It’s okay if you’re still learning certain tools or haven’t worked at scale yet, what matters is being clear about what you have done.Authenticity builds trust, and many companies are open to hiring for potential, not just perfection.Job searching can feel overwhelming, but you're definitely not alone in it, the small changes you make can go a long way! 😊Ambition

Abhishek SinghAbhishek Singh,,"🧠 What Does Super-Powerful AI Look Like?Grateful to Forbes for the deep dive into my MIT talk earlier this year!Right now, the AI world is buzzing with one dominant narrative: that we are racing toward a god-like AGI. With $100M+ hiring packages for top AI researchers and massive capital flows chasing “the one model to rule them all,” it’s easy to get caught up in the mythology.But I believe there’s a different and far more probable story unfolding. One that doesn’t revolve around a single, centralized superintelligence, but rather reflects how the real world actually works: through networks of intelligent, interacting parts. That’s the message I shared in my talk and what this Forbes article explores.Instead of chasing artificial gods, I argued that we should focus on building systems with CHAOS: 1) Coordination: How do different AI agents, tools, and systems work together seamlessly? 2) Heterogeneity: Can they remain diverse in their goals, functions, and perspectives? 3) Scalability: How do we keep lots of them around for redundancy (think resilience) and parallelization.This framework mirrors how real complex systems from biology to neural nets to economies. It is also what makes such systems incredibly hard to model and engineer.But if we can figure out how to instill these principles in AI systems, we won’t need a god-like AGI. We’ll have something better: a society of AI agents, each doing its part, learning from others, and adapting together.At EON, we are bringing these ideas to life by building an operating system where AI agents, tools, and data can come together to improve health at a personal level. If you want to get a sneak peak into what the future of health (and AI) looks like, try out the App today (link in the comments).

Rohan PaulRohan Paul,,"🎯 An ex-OpenAI engineer shares his thoughts about OpenAIHas lots of insights on OpenAI’s day-to-day life, unlike anything I have read before.He joined OpenAI as a software engineer on the applied side, spending about 14 months building the Codex coding agent and related internal prototypes. Most of his time went into writing Python, tuning GPU budgets, and sprinting with a small team to take Codex from first commit to its public launch in 7 weeks.He left because of his own craving for founder freedom, yet calls the year the most eye-opening move of his career. 🚀 Culture shockOpenAI ballooned from 1,000 to 3,000 people in 12 months, so everything from reporting lines to launch flow is in flux. Slack is the office, email basically vanished. Ideas flow bottom-up, and whoever ships first usually decides the standard. Leadership measures worth by shipped code, not slide decks. The place stays secret because the outside world watches every move.🐍 All roads lead to PythonThe author says OpenAI’s code lives in one giant monorepo that is “~mostly Python”. Most backend endpoints spin up with FastAPI, so each team can publish a new service just by writing a few async functions. Request and response bodies flow through Pydantic models, which give runtime checks and lightweight type hints, handy when hundreds of engineers push code every day.He adds that a handful of Rust and Go services handle network-heavy edges, but they are exceptions. Style guides are loose, so you bump into everything from polished, Google-style libraries to quick Jupyter prototypes. That variety makes the repo look messy, yet the FastAPI + Pydantic duo keeps data contracts stable and lets teams ship fast even as headcount rockets past 3,000 engineers.⚙️ Building at break-neck speedA tiny crew built Codex in 7 frantic weeks. He says“The Codex sprint was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. Waking up to a newborn at 5:30 every morning. Heading to the office again at 7a. Working most weekends.”GPU bills dwarf every other cost. The stack is a Python monorepo on Azure, peppered with Rust and Go. Breaking tests, duplicate libraries, and a dumping-ground monolith show the pain of hyper-scaling, but bias to action wins. Heavy hiring from Meta keeps infra talent high.🎯 It mattersOpenAI blends Los Alamos-style research with a viral consumer app mindset. Safety work focuses on real-world abuse, not sci-fi doom. Leadership answers Slack threads directly. A huge ambition plus meritocracy can pull off 630,000 code PRs in 53 days.https://lnkd.in/gQtrG2nx----------Are you into AI and LLMs❓ Join my newsletter, 7 Emails on 7 days.

John CosstickJohn Cosstick,,"🚀 Why 73% of AI implementations fail—and how to fix it After analyzing hundreds of AI projects, MIT's CSAIL discovered something surprising: most failures aren't due to advanced concepts, but weak foundational knowledge. Here's the reality: While everyone rushes to learn the latest AI frameworks, they're skipping the fundamentals that actually matter. The missing piece? Data structures and algorithms. Think about it: → Your neural network is only as good as your data processing efficiency → Your recommendation system depends on choosing the right hash tables and graphs → Your model optimization relies on understanding algorithmic complexity What top-performing AI teams do differently: ✅ They invest 40% more time in foundational training ✅ They prioritize computational thinking over tool memorization ✅ They focus on hands-on practice with real-world scenarios ✅ They understand the ""why"" behind every algorithm choice The career impact is massive: AI Engineers with strong foundations: $130K-$200K Senior ML Engineers: $180K-$300K 344% job growth in AI roles over 5 years My take: Interactive, project-based learning beats passive video consumption every time. When your team can decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and design efficient algorithms, you're not just building AI—you're building competitive advantage. The companies winning in AI aren't just hiring talent—they're developing it from the ground up. What's your experience with foundational AI training?
