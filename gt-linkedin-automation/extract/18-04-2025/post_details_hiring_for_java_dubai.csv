Mohammad Al NabulsiMohammad Al Nabulsi,,"The UAE Is Redefining Global Education InvestmentA massive move caught my attention: Mubadala and Dubai Holding joined forces with a global group to acquire Nord Anglia Education in a $14.5B deal one of the biggest education acquisitions ever.This isn’t just business. It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads. Visionary ones build minds. 🇦🇪

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments.

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Amira MohammedAmira Mohammed,,"IPS Dubai was full of energy, innovation, and exciting real estate opportunities.As an architect who always steps into the client’s shoes, I couldn’t help but imagine how the visitor experience could have been more interactive, here is what came to mind :1. A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Mohammad Al NabulsiMohammad Al Nabulsi,,"The UAE Is Redefining Global Education InvestmentA massive move caught my attention: Mubadala and Dubai Holding joined forces with a global group to acquire Nord Anglia Education in a $14.5B deal one of the biggest education acquisitions ever.This isn’t just business. It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments.

Mohammad Al NabulsiMohammad Al Nabulsi,,"The UAE Is Redefining Global Education InvestmentA massive move caught my attention: Mubadala and Dubai Holding joined forces with a global group to acquire Nord Anglia Education in a $14.5B deal one of the biggest education acquisitions ever.This isn’t just business. It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads. Visionary ones build minds. 🇦🇪

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Sandeep PalankarSandeep Palankar,,"Ever wondered why selling just ONE property in Dubai feels like a HUGE win? 🤔My recent visit to this IPS (International Property Show 2025), got me some great insights.Let's be real: With 65,000+ agents in a city with limited prime units, the competition is FIERCE.But the reward? Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector.

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

Hozefa SaifuddinHozefa Saifuddin,,"Remember when setting up in a UAE Free Zone felt like unlocking a treasure chest of tax benefits? Well, the map has changed, and it's time to chart a new course.The UAE's new corporate tax regime is here, and while Free Zone businesses can still enjoy a 0% tax rate, it's not automatic. To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

Well, the map has changed, and it's time to chart a new course.The UAE's new corporate tax regime is here, and while Free Zone businesses can still enjoy a 0% tax rate, it's not automatic. To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

Projetos de referência internacional, como o Zayed International Airport, mostram como é possível entregar soluções complexas com excelência e oferecem aprendizados que podem ser adaptados às realidades locais, respeitando os desafios específicos de cada mercado.Regionalmente, a Turner & Townsend aplica metodologias de classe mundial com olhar atento às necessidades do setor aeroportuário nacional, apoiando na gestão de grandes projetos, desde o planejamento até a entrega.Acreditamos que a evolução da infraestrutura no país depende de uma atuação técnica, estratégica e integrada e seguimos comprometidos em contribuir para um setor mais eficiente, resiliente e preparado para o futuro.hashtag#Infraestrutura hashtag#Aviação hashtag#WeTransformTogether

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

It’s about unlocking strategy, spotting trends, and speaking the language of business.And if I have to share 5 skillsets that are essential for a finance professional to be future-ready in the UAE market, they would be:1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting In a city where industries evolve overnight, static budgets don’t cut it. You need models that breathe with the business.2. Data Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI)It’s no longer about what happened. Stakeholders want to see why it happened, and that too visually, clearly, instantly.3. Automation & Process OptimizationTime is a premium. Automating even 10% of manual tasks can unlock hours for deeper, strategic work.4. Corporate Tax PlanningWith the UAE introducing corporate tax, businesses are seeking finance professionals who can navigate compliance and protect profitability.5. Strategic ThinkingFinance isn’t a back-office function anymore. You are at the table to influence where the business goes next.Dubai moves fast, and finance professionals here must be more than number crunchers. We need to be analysts, advisors, and architects of growth.What's your strongest skill set among the above?Let's connect CA Kathit Parikh 💡 hashtag#Finance hashtag#Jobs hashtag#skillset hashtag#tax hashtag#Strategy hashtag#Business ICAI UAE Dubai hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#Automation

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads.

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

It’s about unlocking strategy, spotting trends, and speaking the language of business.And if I have to share 5 skillsets that are essential for a finance professional to be future-ready in the UAE market, they would be:1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting In a city where industries evolve overnight, static budgets don’t cut it. You need models that breathe with the business.2. Data Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI)It’s no longer about what happened. Stakeholders want to see why it happened, and that too visually, clearly, instantly.3. Automation & Process OptimizationTime is a premium. Automating even 10% of manual tasks can unlock hours for deeper, strategic work.4. Corporate Tax PlanningWith the UAE introducing corporate tax, businesses are seeking finance professionals who can navigate compliance and protect profitability.5. Strategic ThinkingFinance isn’t a back-office function anymore. You are at the table to influence where the business goes next.Dubai moves fast, and finance professionals here must be more than number crunchers. We need to be analysts, advisors, and architects of growth.What's your strongest skill set among the above?Let's connect CA Kathit Parikh 💡 hashtag#Finance hashtag#Jobs hashtag#skillset hashtag#tax hashtag#Strategy hashtag#Business ICAI UAE Dubai hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#Automation

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments.

Sandeep PalankarSandeep Palankar,,"Ever wondered why selling just ONE property in Dubai feels like a HUGE win? 🤔My recent visit to this IPS (International Property Show 2025), got me some great insights.Let's be real: With 65,000+ agents in a city with limited prime units, the competition is FIERCE.But the reward? Selling a single unit of around AED 1-2 million property can mean commissions equivalent to an average annual salary back home. 💰Dubai's allure – safety, cleanliness, no income tax, strategic location – attracts global investors, creating high demand.But landing that deal?That's where the hustle, dedication, and consistency come in.It's a tough game, but the wins can be significant.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateAgentDubai hashtag#HighCommissions hashtag#ToughCompetition hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#TheHustleIsReal hashtag#MakingDeals hashtag#DubaiLife

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector.

Hozefa SaifuddinHozefa Saifuddin,,"Remember when setting up in a UAE Free Zone felt like unlocking a treasure chest of tax benefits? Well, the map has changed, and it's time to chart a new course.The UAE's new corporate tax regime is here, and while Free Zone businesses can still enjoy a 0% tax rate, it's not automatic. To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

It’s about unlocking strategy, spotting trends, and speaking the language of business.And if I have to share 5 skillsets that are essential for a finance professional to be future-ready in the UAE market, they would be:1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting In a city where industries evolve overnight, static budgets don’t cut it. You need models that breathe with the business.2. Data Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI)It’s no longer about what happened. Stakeholders want to see why it happened, and that too visually, clearly, instantly.3. Automation & Process OptimizationTime is a premium. Automating even 10% of manual tasks can unlock hours for deeper, strategic work.4. Corporate Tax PlanningWith the UAE introducing corporate tax, businesses are seeking finance professionals who can navigate compliance and protect profitability.5. Strategic ThinkingFinance isn’t a back-office function anymore. You are at the table to influence where the business goes next.Dubai moves fast, and finance professionals here must be more than number crunchers.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"Buying vs. Renting in Dubai — What’s More Profitable?The debate between buying and renting in Dubai is always on. Some say renting is flexible, others say buying is a smarter, long-term move. So, which is more profitable?Here’s the breakdown:General Thought: Why Buying Beats Renting?Renting might offer short-term convenience, but buying builds real value. You’re investing in an asset, not just paying for a place to stay.The Real Numbers: Rent vs BuyLet’s compare:Monthly Rent: AED 8,333Monthly Mortgage: AED 4,584➡ Buying is 45% cheaper than renting.Over time:Total Rent (5 years): AED 499,980Total Buy (10 years): AED 550,080➡ Renting saves a bit short-term, but you own nothing.➡ Buying builds equity, ownership, and long-term value.Conclusion: Ownership Pays OffIn markets like Dubai where prices are rising, buying means capital growth, rental income potential, and full ownership — while renting leaves you with nothing at the end.Reach out to see how buying can work for you — with real numbers, tailored to your situation!التملك أو الإيجار في دبي؟ الأرقام ما تكذب – التملك أوفر وأذكى. في سوق عقاري سريع النمو مثل دبي، التملّك لا يُعدّ مجرد خيار، بل هو خطوة استراتيجية لبناء أصول حقيقية وتحقيق عوائد مستمرة. أما الإيجار؟ فهو إنفاق شهري دون أي ملكية مستقبلية.لماذا يعتبر التملّك الخيار الأفضل ماليًا؟ لأن القسط الشهري في كثير من الحالات يكون أقل من قيمة الإيجار، ومع مرور الوقت، تصبح المِلكية كاملة لك. بالإضافة إلى إمكانية تحقيق أرباح من ارتفاع قيمة العقار أو تأجيره لاحقًا. في المقابل، الإيجار يُدفع باستمرار دون أي مردود مالي.الأرقام الحقيقية: دعونا نقارن بين الخيارين في الأرقام:الإيجار الشهري: 8,333 درهمقسط التملك الشهري: 4,584 درهم ✅ التملك يوفّر لك 45% من التكاليف الشهرية مقارنة بالإيجار.إجمالي التكاليف:الإيجار ( 5 سنوات): 499,980 درهمالتملك ( 10 سنوات): 550,080 درهم ✅ رغم أن الإيجار قد يوفّر بعض رأس المال على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك يمنحك أصلًا حقيقيًا يبني ثروتك مع الوقت. بينما قد يكون الإيجار خيارًا مرنًا على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك في دبي يوفر استقرارًا ماليًا طويل الأجل وقيمة استثمارية عالية.

Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments.

Mohammad Al NabulsiMohammad Al Nabulsi,,"The UAE Is Redefining Global Education InvestmentA massive move caught my attention: Mubadala and Dubai Holding joined forces with a global group to acquire Nord Anglia Education in a $14.5B deal one of the biggest education acquisitions ever.This isn’t just business. It’s a bold message: the hashtag#UAE isn’t just focusing on local education reform; it’s shaping how the world learns.Why does this matter? •	Mubadala’s $600M equity stake reflects a national strategy to invest in human capital and align with the UAE’s AI and innovation goals. •	Dubai Holding’s involvement shows how deeply education ties into the UAE’s positioning as a global hub for talent, families, and future industries. •	Nord Anglia isn’t just any operator 85,000+ students, 80+ schools in 33 countries, and partnerships with MIT, Juilliard, and UNICEF.The local context is just as powerful: •	827 international schools make the UAE #1 globally per capita. •	220+ of those are in Dubai alone. •	The UAE’s private K-12 market is projected to hit $7.1B by 2027. •	Education remains one of the largest priorities in the federal budget.This deal isn’t just about returns it’s about long term influence, future proofing our youth, and making the UAE a reference point for educational excellence worldwide.Smart nations build roads. Visionary ones build minds. 🇦🇪

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

"Dr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMIDr. Maryam Fouladirad, DBA, MBA, CITP, ACMI",,"🩺  Unlocking Healthcare Excellence in the Middle East: Top Destinations, Leading Doctors, and the Road Ahead (part 1)As the Middle East continues its rapid transformation, one sector rising to the forefront is healthcare. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

Hozefa SaifuddinHozefa Saifuddin,,"Remember when setting up in a UAE Free Zone felt like unlocking a treasure chest of tax benefits? Well, the map has changed, and it's time to chart a new course.The UAE's new corporate tax regime is here, and while Free Zone businesses can still enjoy a 0% tax rate, it's not automatic. To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

It’s about unlocking strategy, spotting trends, and speaking the language of business.And if I have to share 5 skillsets that are essential for a finance professional to be future-ready in the UAE market, they would be:1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting In a city where industries evolve overnight, static budgets don’t cut it. You need models that breathe with the business.2. Data Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI)It’s no longer about what happened. Stakeholders want to see why it happened, and that too visually, clearly, instantly.3. Automation & Process OptimizationTime is a premium. Automating even 10% of manual tasks can unlock hours for deeper, strategic work.4. Corporate Tax PlanningWith the UAE introducing corporate tax, businesses are seeking finance professionals who can navigate compliance and protect profitability.5. Strategic ThinkingFinance isn’t a back-office function anymore. You are at the table to influence where the business goes next.Dubai moves fast, and finance professionals here must be more than number crunchers. We need to be analysts, advisors, and architects of growth.What's your strongest skill set among the above?Let's connect CA Kathit Parikh 💡 hashtag#Finance hashtag#Jobs hashtag#skillset hashtag#tax hashtag#Strategy hashtag#Business ICAI UAE Dubai hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#Automation

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"Buying vs. Renting in Dubai — What’s More Profitable?The debate between buying and renting in Dubai is always on. Some say renting is flexible, others say buying is a smarter, long-term move. So, which is more profitable?Here’s the breakdown:General Thought: Why Buying Beats Renting?Renting might offer short-term convenience, but buying builds real value. You’re investing in an asset, not just paying for a place to stay.The Real Numbers: Rent vs BuyLet’s compare:Monthly Rent: AED 8,333Monthly Mortgage: AED 4,584➡ Buying is 45% cheaper than renting.Over time:Total Rent (5 years): AED 499,980Total Buy (10 years): AED 550,080➡ Renting saves a bit short-term, but you own nothing.➡ Buying builds equity, ownership, and long-term value.Conclusion: Ownership Pays OffIn markets like Dubai where prices are rising, buying means capital growth, rental income potential, and full ownership — while renting leaves you with nothing at the end.Reach out to see how buying can work for you — with real numbers, tailored to your situation!التملك أو الإيجار في دبي؟ الأرقام ما تكذب – التملك أوفر وأذكى. في سوق عقاري سريع النمو مثل دبي، التملّك لا يُعدّ مجرد خيار، بل هو خطوة استراتيجية لبناء أصول حقيقية وتحقيق عوائد مستمرة. أما الإيجار؟ فهو إنفاق شهري دون أي ملكية مستقبلية.لماذا يعتبر التملّك الخيار الأفضل ماليًا؟ لأن القسط الشهري في كثير من الحالات يكون أقل من قيمة الإيجار، ومع مرور الوقت، تصبح المِلكية كاملة لك. بالإضافة إلى إمكانية تحقيق أرباح من ارتفاع قيمة العقار أو تأجيره لاحقًا. في المقابل، الإيجار يُدفع باستمرار دون أي مردود مالي.الأرقام الحقيقية: دعونا نقارن بين الخيارين في الأرقام:الإيجار الشهري: 8,333 درهمقسط التملك الشهري: 4,584 درهم ✅ التملك يوفّر لك 45% من التكاليف الشهرية مقارنة بالإيجار.إجمالي التكاليف:الإيجار ( 5 سنوات): 499,980 درهمالتملك ( 10 سنوات): 550,080 درهم ✅ رغم أن الإيجار قد يوفّر بعض رأس المال على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك يمنحك أصلًا حقيقيًا يبني ثروتك مع الوقت. بينما قد يكون الإيجار خيارًا مرنًا على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك في دبي يوفر استقرارًا ماليًا طويل الأجل وقيمة استثمارية عالية.

A clearer focus on what makes each project stand out would be inspiring.2. Interiors deserve as much spotlight as the beautiful façades.3. VR tech could elevate how people explore spaces.4. Pavilion layouts with more self-guided content could make discovery more intuitive—through interior models, videos, and visual storytelling.Personally, I thought Sustainable City 2.0 was a strong highlight, what I call an inspiring model for future developments. Yet, it felt a bit tech-heavy; a more interactive, human-centered experience could have made it the perfect blend for getting user engagement and interest.It was a great experience overall! and I’m excited to see how it evolves in the coming years!hashtag#IPSDubai hashtag#ArchitectureMatters hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#UserExperienceDesign hashtag#SustainableDesign hashtag#VRinRealEstate hashtag#InteriorDesignMatters hashtag#ArchitectPerspective hashtag#PropertyDevelopment

Jonathan Burns جونثان برنزJonathan Burns جونثان برنز,,"🌍 KSA’s New UBO Disclosure Rules – Initial Observations 🌍 The new Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) disclosure rules of the Ministry of Commerce have now been in effect in Saudi Arabia for two weeks. Based on early experience, here are some key features—and notable sticking points—of the framework:WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION?👉 Only legal entities incorporated in KSA are required to comply. In practice, the entity will have a dedicated page within its government e-portal account to satisfy the UBO disclosure.👉 Important to note: Technically, the disclosure obligation does not extend to shareholders, foreign parent companies, or shell entities in the corporate chain. The responsibility lies with the KSA subsidiary.WHAT TRIGGERS A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION?UBO disclosure obligations can be triggered objectively and subjectively: 1️⃣  Objectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly:  ▪️ ≥25% shareholding or voting rights in a KSA legal entity, and/or  ▪️ the power to appoint or dismiss a KSA legal entity’s manager, the majority of its board members, or its chairperson. 2️⃣ Subjectively, the obligation is triggered by having, directly or indirectly, the ability to “influence” a KSA legal entity’s operations or decisions.⚠️ Sticking point: “Influence” is not defined in the rules, leaving room for interpretation and potential compliance risk.WHO TRIGGERS THE OBLIGATION?👉 Natural persons meeting the above thresholds must be identified. HOWEVER, for corporate entities in the ownership chain meeting any of the above triggers, Article 4.1.e. requires the disclosure of a “legal representative”—even up through multiple levels.⚠️ Sticking point: “Legal representative” is also undefined and may vary depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation.WHEN MUST DISCLOSURE OCCUR?▪️ At incorporation for new entities▪️ By the next commercial register anniversary for existing entities⚠️ Sticking point: There is no grace period, meaning entities nearing their anniversary may face an urgent compliance timeline.📝 Looking ahead...Article 7.3 of the Rules provides that the Ministry will issue a detailed Guide, which should clarify these ambiguities. As of today, that guidance has not yet been released.This summary reflects general observations to date. There are exclusions, exceptions, and additional complexities not addressed here.hashtag#SaudiArabia hashtag#CorporateLaw hashtag#UBO hashtag#Compliance hashtag#RegulatoryUpdates hashtag#KSA hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#CorporateGovernance hashtag#MiddleEastLaw hashtag#LegalUpdates hashtag#MinistryOfCommerce hashtag#KSACompliance hashtag#BeneficialOwnership

Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution- not just in infrastructure but in innovation, specialization, and global reputation. Countries across the region are now competing not only to serve their local populations but also to become global hubs for medical tourism.Here’s a look at where things stand, who’s leading the charge, and what opportunities lie ahead.🏥 Top Healthcare Destinations in the Middle East1. IranOften underrepresented in international rankings due to geopolitical factors, Iran is in fact one of the most advanced medical ecosystems in the region. With a high density of top-tier specialists, state-of-the-art surgical centers, and remarkably affordable pricing, Iran has become a go-to destination for patients from neighboring countries, Central Asia, and even Europe. From oncology and transplant surgery to fertility and reconstructive procedures, Iranian doctors are not only highly skilled but also often pioneers in their fields. Cities like Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Isfahan host globally respected hospitals and research institutions.2. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Dubai and Abu Dhabi have positioned themselves as world-class medical tourism destinations. With internationally accredited hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Dubai Healthcare City, the UAE is attracting patients from across the GCC, Africa, and beyond.3. Saudi Arabia As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in transforming its healthcare sector. Riyadh and Jeddah now host a growing number of specialized hospitals, and the Kingdom is actively pursuing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fast-track innovation and infrastructure.4. QatarHome to Sidra Medicine and Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar is building a reputation for excellence in pediatric and women's health, with a strong focus on research and academic partnerships.5. Jordan and LebanonKnown for decades as go-to destinations for affordable, high-quality care, particularly in cardiology, oncology, and cosmetic procedures. These countries remain key players, especially for patients from North Africa and the Levant.hashtag#Healthcare hashtag#MiddleEast hashtag#HealthTech hashtag#Investment hashtag#Innovation hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#Iran hashtag#UAE hashtag#Saudiarabia hashtag#Qatar hashtag#Jordan hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#doctor

To qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), you need to meet specific criteria:✅ Key Requirements:• Qualifying Income: Earn income from transactions with other Free Zone entities or from defined qualifying activities.• Substance Requirements: Maintain adequate physical presence and operations within the Free Zone.• De Minimis Rule: Ensure non-qualifying income doesn't exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower.• Audited Financials: Prepare and maintain audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS.⚠ Consequences of Non-Compliance: Failing to meet these conditions means losing QFZP status and being subject to the standard 9% corporate tax rate for at least five years.💡 Take Action Now: Review your business activities, ensure compliance with the new regulations, and consult with tax professionals to navigate this transition smoothly.hashtag#UAE hashtag#CorporateTax hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#TaxCompliance hashtag#EconomicDiversification hashtag#TaxStrategy hashtag#QFZP hashtag#Brooksme

John LyonsJohn Lyons,,"From 2009 to 2020, Espace brokers competed for some incredible prizes. Four Rolex watches in a single four month competition, boat parties, and multiple incentive trips to Las Vegas were just a few of the rewards up for grabs.Since COVID, as the Dubai property market has built strong momentum, industry incentives have ramped up once again. But while prizes and perks do play a role in motivation, they’re the easy part of the recipe and should be seen for what they are… the cherry on top.The real engine behind broker success isn’t gimmicks. It’s the strength of the platform they operate in. At Espace, everything is built around one core focus: creating a marketplace that gives brokers the highest possible chance to perform at their best and deliver exceptional revenue.While anyone can compete in the incentives game, it’s not a level playing field when it comes to the strength of the marketplace itself, and that’s where the real difference is made.hashtag#espacerealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#mydubai hashtag#dubaibrokers hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#property hashtag#propertymarket

It’s about unlocking strategy, spotting trends, and speaking the language of business.And if I have to share 5 skillsets that are essential for a finance professional to be future-ready in the UAE market, they would be:1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting In a city where industries evolve overnight, static budgets don’t cut it. You need models that breathe with the business.2. Data Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI)It’s no longer about what happened. Stakeholders want to see why it happened, and that too visually, clearly, instantly.3. Automation & Process OptimizationTime is a premium. Automating even 10% of manual tasks can unlock hours for deeper, strategic work.4. Corporate Tax PlanningWith the UAE introducing corporate tax, businesses are seeking finance professionals who can navigate compliance and protect profitability.5. Strategic ThinkingFinance isn’t a back-office function anymore. You are at the table to influence where the business goes next.Dubai moves fast, and finance professionals here must be more than number crunchers. We need to be analysts, advisors, and architects of growth.What's your strongest skill set among the above?Let's connect CA Kathit Parikh 💡 hashtag#Finance hashtag#Jobs hashtag#skillset hashtag#tax hashtag#Strategy hashtag#Business ICAI UAE Dubai hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#Automation

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"Buying vs. Renting in Dubai — What’s More Profitable?The debate between buying and renting in Dubai is always on. Some say renting is flexible, others say buying is a smarter, long-term move. So, which is more profitable?Here’s the breakdown:General Thought: Why Buying Beats Renting?Renting might offer short-term convenience, but buying builds real value. You’re investing in an asset, not just paying for a place to stay.The Real Numbers: Rent vs BuyLet’s compare:Monthly Rent: AED 8,333Monthly Mortgage: AED 4,584➡ Buying is 45% cheaper than renting.Over time:Total Rent (5 years): AED 499,980Total Buy (10 years): AED 550,080➡ Renting saves a bit short-term, but you own nothing.➡ Buying builds equity, ownership, and long-term value.Conclusion: Ownership Pays OffIn markets like Dubai where prices are rising, buying means capital growth, rental income potential, and full ownership — while renting leaves you with nothing at the end.Reach out to see how buying can work for you — with real numbers, tailored to your situation!التملك أو الإيجار في دبي؟ الأرقام ما تكذب – التملك أوفر وأذكى. في سوق عقاري سريع النمو مثل دبي، التملّك لا يُعدّ مجرد خيار، بل هو خطوة استراتيجية لبناء أصول حقيقية وتحقيق عوائد مستمرة. أما الإيجار؟ فهو إنفاق شهري دون أي ملكية مستقبلية.لماذا يعتبر التملّك الخيار الأفضل ماليًا؟ لأن القسط الشهري في كثير من الحالات يكون أقل من قيمة الإيجار، ومع مرور الوقت، تصبح المِلكية كاملة لك. بالإضافة إلى إمكانية تحقيق أرباح من ارتفاع قيمة العقار أو تأجيره لاحقًا. في المقابل، الإيجار يُدفع باستمرار دون أي مردود مالي.الأرقام الحقيقية: دعونا نقارن بين الخيارين في الأرقام:الإيجار الشهري: 8,333 درهمقسط التملك الشهري: 4,584 درهم ✅ التملك يوفّر لك 45% من التكاليف الشهرية مقارنة بالإيجار.إجمالي التكاليف:الإيجار ( 5 سنوات): 499,980 درهمالتملك ( 10 سنوات): 550,080 درهم ✅ رغم أن الإيجار قد يوفّر بعض رأس المال على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك يمنحك أصلًا حقيقيًا يبني ثروتك مع الوقت. بينما قد يكون الإيجار خيارًا مرنًا على المدى القصير، إلا أن التملك في دبي يوفر استقرارًا ماليًا طويل الأجل وقيمة استثمارية عالية.
