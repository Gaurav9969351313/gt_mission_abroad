Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest

Marcos FontenlaMarcos Fontenla,,"Ever used AsNoTracking() in EF Core? It can be the difference between a slow API and a fast one 🚀🧠 What is AsNoTracking()?By default, when you query entities using Entity Framework Core, the DbContext tracks those entities so it can detect changes and persist them later with SaveChanges().But what if you're just reading data? 🤔 You don’t need tracking — and that's where AsNoTracking() comes in.✅ Why should you use it? 🔹 Improves read performance. 🔹 Reduces memory usage. 🔹 Avoids the overhead of the change tracker. 🔹 Perfect for GET endpoints, reports, dashboards, etc.⚠️ When NOT to use AsNoTracking()? ➡️ When you plan to modify and save those entities. ➡️ When you need complex relationship tracking or entity change detection.📌 Pro Tip: If you're following a CQRS pattern, consider using AsNoTracking() by default for all queries, and enable tracking only for commands (create/update/delete operations).💬 Do you already use AsNoTracking() in your repositories? Do you separate queries and commands in your architecture?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#EntityFrameworkCore hashtag#AsNoTracking hashtag#Performance hashtag#CleanArchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#backend hashtag#apirest
