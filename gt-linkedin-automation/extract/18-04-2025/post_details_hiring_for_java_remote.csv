A lot. 😅When your workday mostly happens at a desk (or let’s be honest, sometimes the couch), it’s easy to forget how important movement is. For me, the gym 🏋️‍♀️ has become more than just a fitness goal — it’s my daily reset button 🔄🧠If you're working remotely and feeling drained or stiff , I can’t recommend it enough: move your body!

Mercy MutukuMercy Mutuku,,"Proof that ""office"" is more of a mindset than a location! Straight from a joyful family celebration to tackling what needed doing.That's the quirky beauty of working from home.Your office travels with you! I located my temporary ""office"" and jumped into action.Honestly, there's a real buzz in being able to jump in and help clients, even on a day like that. It's a different kind of rewarding. Sure, sometimes the dream is to completely unplug on a getaway, let the emails gather dust, and embrace full holiday mode. But hey, flexibility is our superpower, and knowing you can be there when needed?
