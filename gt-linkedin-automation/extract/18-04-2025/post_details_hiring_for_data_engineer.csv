kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor?

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor?

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

kennedy Ngurekennedy Ngure,,"I thought I was irreplaceable—until I was replaced.After graduating in 2016 as a mechanical engineering craftsman, I landed a job in traffic surveys. It paid well and took me across Africa—Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRC, Ghana, Tanzania, Somaliland, Togo, and Nigeria.From 2018 to 2023, I was part of major projects, even during COVID. I became highly skilled in traffic data collection, analysis, and equipment maintenance. Clients trusted me. I thought I was secure.But in 2023, I was replaced.It was painful. I had the skills and experience, but no degree in civil engineering, no official company, and no certifications. I realized I had built my value within a system I didn’t own. I needed the company more than it needed me.A few clients began to notice I wasn’t showing up on some of their projects. They reached out, asking, “Where are you?” I had to tell them the truth: I was fired. It was one of the hardest things to say out loud.But one client said something that changed my life:""Why don’t you start your own company? You have everything you need—take that next step.""So I did.Today, I’m the founder of my own traffic survey company. I’m upgrading my knowledge through online courses, hiring engineers on project-based contracts, and building something I can call mine.This journey has taught me that:Your skill is your seed. Your mindset is your water. Your vision is your soil.If you’re feeling stuck or overlooked, don’t give up. Build something of your own. Start small, but start.🚀 hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#TrafficEngineering hashtag#FromEmployeeToOwner hashtag#AfricaRising hashtag#EngineeringJourney hashtag#Inspiration hashtag#Resilience hashtag#Leadership

Evans NtaboEvans Ntabo,,"The main challenge in AWS Data Analytics is often:MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING COSTS WHILE SCALING DATA INFRASTRUCTUREHere’s why this stands out:1. Cost Complexity with ScalabilityAs you scale up your data pipelines, storage, and compute (e.g., with services like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Glue, Athena, or S3), costs can skyrocket if not carefully monitored.Many services are pay-as-you-go, so inefficient queries, unused resources, or misconfigured jobs can rack up huge bills fast.2. Data Integration and Pipeline ComplexityAWS offers powerful tools, but orchestrating end-to-end pipelines (e.g., ingest → transform → store → analyze) often involves several services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Step Functions).Integrating them securely, efficiently, and with good observability is a non-trivial task.3. Data Governance and SecurityManaging access (e.g., via IAM roles/policies), encryption, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) is a challenge, especially in large, distributed environments.4. Talent and Skills GapAWS has a steep learning curve, and many companies lack team members with the deep expertise required to build optimized, secure, scalable data analytics solutions.5. Query Optimization & Data ModelingTools like Athena or Redshift can underperform if the underlying data is not well-modeled or if queries are poorly structured.Partitioning, file formats (Parquet vs. CSV), and compression can drastically affect performance and cost.hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechSolutions hashtag#Challenges

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy
