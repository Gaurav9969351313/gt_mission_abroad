Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Amirhosein EbrahimiAmirhosein Ebrahimi,,"ًReliability تحلیلی نوآورانه از قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های نرم‌افزاری مبتنی بر کامپوننت (CBS)در سال‌های اخیر، با رشد پیچیدگی نرم‌افزارها و افزایش استفاده از سبک‌های معماری متنوع، ارزیابی و بهبود قابلیت اطمینان سیستم به یکی از چالش‌های کلیدی مهندسی نرم‌افزار تبدیل شده. مقاله‌ درجه یکی پیدا کردم که، مدلی جالب و قابل تعمیم برای تحلیل قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های مبتنی بر مؤلفه (Component-Based Systems) ارائه می‌دهد. نکات کلیدی مقاله: این مقاله مفهومی به نام ""Component Influence"" معرفی می‌کنه که ترکیبی از سه بُعد مختلف اثرگذاری مؤلفه‌ها بر قابلیت اطمینان کلی سیستم هست:Self-Influence: میزان استفاده و فراخوانی مؤلفه در جریان اجرای سیستمFailure Influence: تعداد و شدت وابستگی کامپوننت های دیگر به این کامپوننتFault Propagation Influence: قدرت انتقال خطا از این کامپوننت به سایر کامپوننت هابرای محاسبه این فاکتورها، مقاله از یک مدل گراف جهت‌دار و همچنین یک مدل گذار وضعیت جهانی (Global State Transition Model) استفاده کرده که سبک‌های معماری مختلف مثل parallel, fault-tolerant, circuit breaker و ... رو هم در نظر می‌گیره. با تنظیم ضرایب وزن‌دهی (α1 و α2) برای ترکیب این سه بُعد، مدل قابلیت تحلیل دقیق‌تری از اهمیت کامپوننت نسبت به مدل‌های سنتی ارائه می‌ده. بررسی‌های تجربی هم نشون می‌دن که افزایش قابلیت اطمینان یک کامپوننت با تأثیر بالا (مثل C9 در سیستم بانکی مطالعه‌شده) می‌تونه تأثیر بسیار بیشتری بر کل سیستم داشته باشه نسبت به کامپوننت هایی با تأثیر پایین (مثل C3). مقاله همچنین مدل خودش رو با سه مدل مرجع در ادبیات (Cheung, Lo, Wang) مقایسه کرده و نتایج بسیار منسجمی به‌دست آورده که اعتبار مدل پیشنهادی رو تقویت می‌کنه.📌 مناسب برای مطالعه اگر:روی سیستم‌های بحرانی یا mission-critical کار می‌کنیدبا تحلیل معماری و سبک‌های ترکیبی نرم‌افزار سروکار داریدبه دنبال راهکارهای بهینه برای بهبود reliability سیستم‌های توزیع‌شده یا پیچیده هستیدhashtag#SoftwareReliability hashtag#ComponentAnalysis hashtag#ArchitecturalStyles hashtag#CBS hashtag#Dependability hashtag#ResearchInsight hashtag#StateTransitionModelلینک مقاله : https://lnkd.in/dgE8VKCY

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Amirhosein EbrahimiAmirhosein Ebrahimi,,"ًReliability تحلیلی نوآورانه از قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های نرم‌افزاری مبتنی بر کامپوننت (CBS)در سال‌های اخیر، با رشد پیچیدگی نرم‌افزارها و افزایش استفاده از سبک‌های معماری متنوع، ارزیابی و بهبود قابلیت اطمینان سیستم به یکی از چالش‌های کلیدی مهندسی نرم‌افزار تبدیل شده. مقاله‌ درجه یکی پیدا کردم که، مدلی جالب و قابل تعمیم برای تحلیل قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های مبتنی بر مؤلفه (Component-Based Systems) ارائه می‌دهد. نکات کلیدی مقاله: این مقاله مفهومی به نام ""Component Influence"" معرفی می‌کنه که ترکیبی از سه بُعد مختلف اثرگذاری مؤلفه‌ها بر قابلیت اطمینان کلی سیستم هست:Self-Influence: میزان استفاده و فراخوانی مؤلفه در جریان اجرای سیستمFailure Influence: تعداد و شدت وابستگی کامپوننت های دیگر به این کامپوننتFault Propagation Influence: قدرت انتقال خطا از این کامپوننت به سایر کامپوننت هابرای محاسبه این فاکتورها، مقاله از یک مدل گراف جهت‌دار و همچنین یک مدل گذار وضعیت جهانی (Global State Transition Model) استفاده کرده که سبک‌های معماری مختلف مثل parallel, fault-tolerant, circuit breaker و ... رو هم در نظر می‌گیره. با تنظیم ضرایب وزن‌دهی (α1 و α2) برای ترکیب این سه بُعد، مدل قابلیت تحلیل دقیق‌تری از اهمیت کامپوننت نسبت به مدل‌های سنتی ارائه می‌ده. بررسی‌های تجربی هم نشون می‌دن که افزایش قابلیت اطمینان یک کامپوننت با تأثیر بالا (مثل C9 در سیستم بانکی مطالعه‌شده) می‌تونه تأثیر بسیار بیشتری بر کل سیستم داشته باشه نسبت به کامپوننت هایی با تأثیر پایین (مثل C3). مقاله همچنین مدل خودش رو با سه مدل مرجع در ادبیات (Cheung, Lo, Wang) مقایسه کرده و نتایج بسیار منسجمی به‌دست آورده که اعتبار مدل پیشنهادی رو تقویت می‌کنه.📌 مناسب برای مطالعه اگر:روی سیستم‌های بحرانی یا mission-critical کار می‌کنیدبا تحلیل معماری و سبک‌های ترکیبی نرم‌افزار سروکار داریدبه دنبال راهکارهای بهینه برای بهبود reliability سیستم‌های توزیع‌شده یا پیچیده هستیدhashtag#SoftwareReliability hashtag#ComponentAnalysis hashtag#ArchitecturalStyles hashtag#CBS hashtag#Dependability hashtag#ResearchInsight hashtag#StateTransitionModelلینک مقاله : https://lnkd.in/dgE8VKCY

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Amirhosein EbrahimiAmirhosein Ebrahimi,,"ًReliability تحلیلی نوآورانه از قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های نرم‌افزاری مبتنی بر کامپوننت (CBS)در سال‌های اخیر، با رشد پیچیدگی نرم‌افزارها و افزایش استفاده از سبک‌های معماری متنوع، ارزیابی و بهبود قابلیت اطمینان سیستم به یکی از چالش‌های کلیدی مهندسی نرم‌افزار تبدیل شده. مقاله‌ درجه یکی پیدا کردم که، مدلی جالب و قابل تعمیم برای تحلیل قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های مبتنی بر مؤلفه (Component-Based Systems) ارائه می‌دهد. نکات کلیدی مقاله: این مقاله مفهومی به نام ""Component Influence"" معرفی می‌کنه که ترکیبی از سه بُعد مختلف اثرگذاری مؤلفه‌ها بر قابلیت اطمینان کلی سیستم هست:Self-Influence: میزان استفاده و فراخوانی مؤلفه در جریان اجرای سیستمFailure Influence: تعداد و شدت وابستگی کامپوننت های دیگر به این کامپوننتFault Propagation Influence: قدرت انتقال خطا از این کامپوننت به سایر کامپوننت هابرای محاسبه این فاکتورها، مقاله از یک مدل گراف جهت‌دار و همچنین یک مدل گذار وضعیت جهانی (Global State Transition Model) استفاده کرده که سبک‌های معماری مختلف مثل parallel, fault-tolerant, circuit breaker و ... رو هم در نظر می‌گیره. با تنظیم ضرایب وزن‌دهی (α1 و α2) برای ترکیب این سه بُعد، مدل قابلیت تحلیل دقیق‌تری از اهمیت کامپوننت نسبت به مدل‌های سنتی ارائه می‌ده. بررسی‌های تجربی هم نشون می‌دن که افزایش قابلیت اطمینان یک کامپوننت با تأثیر بالا (مثل C9 در سیستم بانکی مطالعه‌شده) می‌تونه تأثیر بسیار بیشتری بر کل سیستم داشته باشه نسبت به کامپوننت هایی با تأثیر پایین (مثل C3). مقاله همچنین مدل خودش رو با سه مدل مرجع در ادبیات (Cheung, Lo, Wang) مقایسه کرده و نتایج بسیار منسجمی به‌دست آورده که اعتبار مدل پیشنهادی رو تقویت می‌کنه.📌 مناسب برای مطالعه اگر:روی سیستم‌های بحرانی یا mission-critical کار می‌کنیدبا تحلیل معماری و سبک‌های ترکیبی نرم‌افزار سروکار داریدبه دنبال راهکارهای بهینه برای بهبود reliability سیستم‌های توزیع‌شده یا پیچیده هستیدhashtag#SoftwareReliability hashtag#ComponentAnalysis hashtag#ArchitecturalStyles hashtag#CBS hashtag#Dependability hashtag#ResearchInsight hashtag#StateTransitionModelلینک مقاله : https://lnkd.in/dgE8VKCY

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hossein MolaeiHossein Molaei,,"در این پست میخوام یک تسک مصاحبه را شرح بدم.علت انتشار این پست توهین به زمان و شعور بنده است که بخاطر موقعیت مکانی بنده را رد کردند تازه بعد از اینکه تسک را کامل نوشتم 😅همون اول میتونستن بگن جناب موقعیت مکانی شما بدرد ما نمیخورهتسک:### Task Breakdown#### Objective:The candidate must build a simple RESTful API for a blog application using ASP.NET Core. This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging. ASP.NET Core logging can be used to log to the console or a file.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Amirhosein EbrahimiAmirhosein Ebrahimi,,"ًReliability تحلیلی نوآورانه از قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های نرم‌افزاری مبتنی بر کامپوننت (CBS)در سال‌های اخیر، با رشد پیچیدگی نرم‌افزارها و افزایش استفاده از سبک‌های معماری متنوع، ارزیابی و بهبود قابلیت اطمینان سیستم به یکی از چالش‌های کلیدی مهندسی نرم‌افزار تبدیل شده. مقاله‌ درجه یکی پیدا کردم که، مدلی جالب و قابل تعمیم برای تحلیل قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های مبتنی بر مؤلفه (Component-Based Systems) ارائه می‌دهد. نکات کلیدی مقاله: این مقاله مفهومی به نام ""Component Influence"" معرفی می‌کنه که ترکیبی از سه بُعد مختلف اثرگذاری مؤلفه‌ها بر قابلیت اطمینان کلی سیستم هست:Self-Influence: میزان استفاده و فراخوانی مؤلفه در جریان اجرای سیستمFailure Influence: تعداد و شدت وابستگی کامپوننت های دیگر به این کامپوننتFault Propagation Influence: قدرت انتقال خطا از این کامپوننت به سایر کامپوننت هابرای محاسبه این فاکتورها، مقاله از یک مدل گراف جهت‌دار و همچنین یک مدل گذار وضعیت جهانی (Global State Transition Model) استفاده کرده که سبک‌های معماری مختلف مثل parallel, fault-tolerant, circuit breaker و ... رو هم در نظر می‌گیره. با تنظیم ضرایب وزن‌دهی (α1 و α2) برای ترکیب این سه بُعد، مدل قابلیت تحلیل دقیق‌تری از اهمیت کامپوننت نسبت به مدل‌های سنتی ارائه می‌ده. بررسی‌های تجربی هم نشون می‌دن که افزایش قابلیت اطمینان یک کامپوننت با تأثیر بالا (مثل C9 در سیستم بانکی مطالعه‌شده) می‌تونه تأثیر بسیار بیشتری بر کل سیستم داشته باشه نسبت به کامپوننت هایی با تأثیر پایین (مثل C3). مقاله همچنین مدل خودش رو با سه مدل مرجع در ادبیات (Cheung, Lo, Wang) مقایسه کرده و نتایج بسیار منسجمی به‌دست آورده که اعتبار مدل پیشنهادی رو تقویت می‌کنه.📌 مناسب برای مطالعه اگر:روی سیستم‌های بحرانی یا mission-critical کار می‌کنیدبا تحلیل معماری و سبک‌های ترکیبی نرم‌افزار سروکار داریدبه دنبال راهکارهای بهینه برای بهبود reliability سیستم‌های توزیع‌شده یا پیچیده هستیدhashtag#SoftwareReliability hashtag#ComponentAnalysis hashtag#ArchitecturalStyles hashtag#CBS hashtag#Dependability hashtag#ResearchInsight hashtag#StateTransitionModelلینک مقاله : https://lnkd.in/dgE8VKCY

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hossein MolaeiHossein Molaei,,"در این پست میخوام یک تسک مصاحبه را شرح بدم.علت انتشار این پست توهین به زمان و شعور بنده است که بخاطر موقعیت مکانی بنده را رد کردند تازه بعد از اینکه تسک را کامل نوشتم 😅همون اول میتونستن بگن جناب موقعیت مکانی شما بدرد ما نمیخورهتسک:### Task Breakdown#### Objective:The candidate must build a simple RESTful API for a blog application using ASP.NET Core. This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging. ASP.NET Core logging can be used to log to the console or a file.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Hardesh HiraHardesh Hira,,"Just a little honest chit chat with a good friend, hope you like it, give me your feedback :)"
kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

Amirhosein EbrahimiAmirhosein Ebrahimi,,"ًReliability تحلیلی نوآورانه از قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های نرم‌افزاری مبتنی بر کامپوننت (CBS)در سال‌های اخیر، با رشد پیچیدگی نرم‌افزارها و افزایش استفاده از سبک‌های معماری متنوع، ارزیابی و بهبود قابلیت اطمینان سیستم به یکی از چالش‌های کلیدی مهندسی نرم‌افزار تبدیل شده. مقاله‌ درجه یکی پیدا کردم که، مدلی جالب و قابل تعمیم برای تحلیل قابلیت اطمینان در سیستم‌های مبتنی بر مؤلفه (Component-Based Systems) ارائه می‌دهد. نکات کلیدی مقاله: این مقاله مفهومی به نام ""Component Influence"" معرفی می‌کنه که ترکیبی از سه بُعد مختلف اثرگذاری مؤلفه‌ها بر قابلیت اطمینان کلی سیستم هست:Self-Influence: میزان استفاده و فراخوانی مؤلفه در جریان اجرای سیستمFailure Influence: تعداد و شدت وابستگی کامپوننت های دیگر به این کامپوننتFault Propagation Influence: قدرت انتقال خطا از این کامپوننت به سایر کامپوننت هابرای محاسبه این فاکتورها، مقاله از یک مدل گراف جهت‌دار و همچنین یک مدل گذار وضعیت جهانی (Global State Transition Model) استفاده کرده که سبک‌های معماری مختلف مثل parallel, fault-tolerant, circuit breaker و ... رو هم در نظر می‌گیره. با تنظیم ضرایب وزن‌دهی (α1 و α2) برای ترکیب این سه بُعد، مدل قابلیت تحلیل دقیق‌تری از اهمیت کامپوننت نسبت به مدل‌های سنتی ارائه می‌ده. بررسی‌های تجربی هم نشون می‌دن که افزایش قابلیت اطمینان یک کامپوننت با تأثیر بالا (مثل C9 در سیستم بانکی مطالعه‌شده) می‌تونه تأثیر بسیار بیشتری بر کل سیستم داشته باشه نسبت به کامپوننت هایی با تأثیر پایین (مثل C3). مقاله همچنین مدل خودش رو با سه مدل مرجع در ادبیات (Cheung, Lo, Wang) مقایسه کرده و نتایج بسیار منسجمی به‌دست آورده که اعتبار مدل پیشنهادی رو تقویت می‌کنه.📌 مناسب برای مطالعه اگر:روی سیستم‌های بحرانی یا mission-critical کار می‌کنیدبا تحلیل معماری و سبک‌های ترکیبی نرم‌افزار سروکار داریدبه دنبال راهکارهای بهینه برای بهبود reliability سیستم‌های توزیع‌شده یا پیچیده هستیدhashtag#SoftwareReliability hashtag#ComponentAnalysis hashtag#ArchitecturalStyles hashtag#CBS hashtag#Dependability hashtag#ResearchInsight hashtag#StateTransitionModelلینک مقاله : https://lnkd.in/dgE8VKCY

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging.

Hassan ZikeriaHassan Zikeria,,"➡️""Why OSPF Still Matters—Even in a FortiGate World""⬅️(لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate)In a world full of SD-WAN and cloud-centric networking, it’s easy to overlook traditional protocols like OSPF. But last week, while redesigning a branch topology using FortiGate, I was reminded just how powerful and relevant OSPF still is.Here’s what happened:We had a multi-branch setup with dynamic routing needs, redundancy requirements, and a mandate to minimize manual configs. FortiGate’s capabilities made the security part easy—but OSPF stepped in to do the heavy lifting on routing.A few key takeaways:OSPF’s link-state database gave us deep visibility into route changes.FortiGate’s dynamic routing support is more robust than many give it credit for.Tuning OSPF cost and timers within FortiOS CLI still gives you precise control when needed.This isn’t a debate between old vs. new—it’s about knowing what tool to use when.Curious to hear from others: Are you still leveraging OSPF with FortiGate? How are you balancing legacy protocols with modern network needs?Let’s talk tech that actually works in production.In Arabic: ⬅️ لماذا لا يزال OSPF مهماً—حتى في عالم FortiGate:في عالم مليء بتقنيات SD-WAN والشبكات المركزة على السحابة، من السهل أن نتغاضى عن البروتوكولات التقليدية مثل OSPF. لكن الأسبوع الماضي، أثناء إعادة تصميم طوبولوجيا فرعية باستخدام FortiGate، تذكرت مدى قوة وأهمية OSPF حتى الآن.إليكم ما حدث:كان لدينا إعداد متعدد الفروع مع احتياجات توجيه ديناميكية، متطلبات التكرار، وتكليف بتقليل الإعدادات اليدوية. قدرات FortiGate جعلت الجانب الأمني سهلاً—لكن OSPF تولى العبء الثقيل في التوجيه.بعض النقاط الرئيسية:قاعدة بيانات حالة الارتباط في OSPF منحتنا رؤية عميقة لتغيرات المسارات.دعم FortiGate للتوجيه الديناميكي أكثر قوة مما يُنسب إليه عادة.تهيئة تكلفة OSPF والمؤقتات ضمن واجهة CLI في FortiOS لا تزال تمنحك تحكماً دقيقاً عند الحاجة.هذه ليست مناقشة بين القديم والجديد—بل عن معرفة الأداة المناسبة للاستخدام في الوقت المناسب.أتطلع لسماع آرائكم: هل لا زلتم تستفيدون من OSPF مع FortiGate؟ كيف توازنون بين البروتوكولات التقليدية واحتياجات الشبكات الحديثة؟دعونا نتحدث عن التقنيات التي تعمل فعلياً في البيئات الإنتاجية.hashtag#Networking hashtag#OSPF hashtag#Fortinet hashtag#FortiGatehashtag#NetworkEngineering hashtag#Cybersecurity#Routing#ITCommunity#TechLeadership

kayode Ayodejikayode Ayodeji,,"CAN A DOMESTIC AGREEMENT BE ENFORCED?In the law of contract, There exist a presumption that social and domestic agreements are not enforceable, in other words they are not binding. The reason for this is that, it is presumed that there are no intentions to create legal relations when engaging in social and domestic agreements due to the nature of the agreements.This presumption is a rebuttable one. This means that there are instances where the court may infer an intention to create legal relations and enforce a domestic agreement.These instances may be regarded as the exceptions to the general presumption. These instances when proved or established, negates the presumption that social and domestic agreements are not binding.These instances are;When the parties within the domestic relationship were clearly not living in amity as at the time the agreement was made. This includes a situation where a couple are living apart as a result of a breakdown in the marriage. See the case of MERRITT V MERRITT.Again, a domestic agreement may be enforceable in situations were a party has made a great sacrifice in the process of making the agreement that it would be unfair and lead to great injustice if the agreement is not enforceable. In this instance, the great sacrifice represents consideration. See the case of PARKER V CLARK.Finally, a domestic agreement may be enforced by a court of law where evidence is adduced to show that parties to the contract  did intend to create legal relations in the terms of the agreement. This is because parties are free to agree to whatever they want to, so far it is within the ambit of the law.

Hossein MolaeiHossein Molaei,,"در این پست میخوام یک تسک مصاحبه را شرح بدم.علت انتشار این پست توهین به زمان و شعور بنده است که بخاطر موقعیت مکانی بنده را رد کردند تازه بعد از اینکه تسک را کامل نوشتم 😅همون اول میتونستن بگن جناب موقعیت مکانی شما بدرد ما نمیخورهتسک:### Task Breakdown#### Objective:The candidate must build a simple RESTful API for a blog application using ASP.NET Core. This task evaluates their ability to create a basic web service with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.#### Detailed Requirements:1. Create a New Blog Post: - HTTP Method: POST - Route: /api/posts - Request Body: JSON containing the required fields (e.g., title, content, author). - Validation: Ensure that title and content are not empty. - Response: Return the created post along with a success status code (e.g., 201 Created).2. Retrieve All Blog Posts: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts - Response: Return a list of all blog posts in JSON format.3. Retrieve a Single Blog Post: - HTTP Method: GET - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return the specific blog post if it exists or an error status (e.g., 404 Not Found).4. Update a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: PUT - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Request Body: JSON with updated fields for the blog post. - Validation: Similar to creation, validate non-empty fields. - Response: Return the updated post or an appropriate error status if the post doesn't exist.5. Delete a Blog Post: - HTTP Method: DELETE - Route: /api/posts/{id} - Response: Return a success status for deletion or an error status if the post doesn't exist.#### Technical Choices:- ASP.NET Core: Use the latest version to leverage contemporary features and practices.- Entity Framework Core: Use for data access. An in-memory database can be used for simplicity during the test setup and execution.- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to manage cases like invalid data, missing resources, etc.- Model Validation: Utilize ASP.NET Core’s built-in validation framework to ensure data integrity.#### Unit Testing:- Write at least two unit tests to verify the application’s behavior. This could include tests for: - Successfully creating a blog post. - Fetching a non-existent blog post returns the appropriate error.#### Bonus Points:- Pagination: Implement pagination for the list of blog posts with query parameters like pageNumber and pageSize.- Logging: Introduce logging for critical operations to aid in monitoring and debugging. ASP.NET Core logging can be used to log to the console or a file.

Amr Al SioufyAmr Al Sioufy,,"(Linux + Git) inventor, Linus Torvalds is the goat?"
Gil BanyasGil Banyas,,"I think there’s something many people miss about contracts. They’re not there to guarantee performance. They’re there to manage failure. When things are going well, no one’s reading the contract. It’s when timelines slip, priorities change, or someone goes silent — that’s when the wording starts to matter. That’s why I’m cautious about over-engineering contract language just to make it look more precise. Too often, we trade familiar legal terms with decades of precedent for made-up phrasing that feels clear — but isn’t. And in doing so, we make things harder to interpret, harder to enforce — and harder for both humans and machines to understand. Clarity is about holding up under pressure — in courtrooms, in escalations, and in systems that need to process contracts at scale.
