Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities.

Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share? Comment below your story could help someone else feel seen.hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#CareerBreak hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringWithEmpathy

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 RWAs Are the Future of Finance—Here’s Why You Should Care 💡Imagine this: 🤯 You could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in Manhattan 🏙️, or even invest in a U.S. treasury bond 💵—all without a bank 🏦 or broker 🤝.Welcome to the world of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) 🌐—where physical assets like real estate, bonds, and invoices are brought on‑chain 🔗.Why does this matter? 🤔Here’s how it’s already transforming finance:🏠 Real Estate: Platforms like RealT let you invest in tokenized properties. Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

Own a slice of a house and earn rental income 💰, without the hassle of being a landlord 🗝️.💵 Treasury Bonds: Giants like Franklin Templeton are tokenizing U.S. bonds, making them tradable 24/7 🕒 on public blockchains like Polygon 🔄.📄 Invoices: Projects like Centrifuge let businesses tokenize invoices and use them as collateral in DeFi to unlock instant liquidity 💧.What’s the impact? 🌍 • 🌐 Access: Anyone, anywhere can invest in high‑value assets. • 💧 Liquidity: Trade traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or bonds with a few clicks 🖱️. • 🔍 Transparency: All ownership and transfers are recorded on‑chain. • ⚡ Speed: Settle in seconds ⏱️, not days 🗓️.But there are still hurdles: 🛑 • ⚖️ Regulatory clarity is still evolving. • 🏢 Custody of physical assets needs secure, trusted frameworks. • 🔗 Interoperability between DeFi and TradFi isn’t seamless yet.The Hybrid Future 🔄 We’re not talking about DeFi replacing TradFi. We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits).

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

We’re talking about DeFi enhancing it 🌟.Big names like BlackRock are experimenting with tokenized assets 💼, while luxury platforms tokenize fine art 🎨, wine 🍷, and jewelry 💎 for global investors.The result? 🎉 --> A financial system that’s more open 🔓, efficient ⚙️, and transparent 🚀 for everyone.RWAs could be the Trojan horse 🐴 that brings billions into DeFi.What’s your take? 💭hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#DeFi hashtag#TradFi hashtag#Tokenization hashtag#Web3 hashtag#RWAs hashtag#FutureOfFinance hashtag#Crypto hashtag#Web3 hashtag#NFTs hashtag#Minting hashtag#CryptoBeginners hashtag#DigitalOwnership hashtag#BlockchainBasics hashtag#Solana hashtag#Ethereum hashtag#CreativeEconomy hashtag#aiagents hashtag#crypto hashtag#developerjourney hashtag#gpt4 hashtag#fintech hashtag#nodejs hashtag#Cryptocurrency hashtag#Bitcoin hashtag#SmartContracts hashtag#Metaverse hashtag#AI hashtag#DAO hashtag#Tokenomics hashtag#Dapp hashtag#Solidity hashtag#Decentralization hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#Google hashtag#Intel hashtag#NVIDIA hashtag#AWS hashtag#Meta hashtag#IBM hashtag#Tesla hashtag#Apple hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Investing hashtag#Technology hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Startups hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Jobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#DataScience hashtag#SaaS hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FullStack hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Python hashtag#Rust hashtag#GoLang hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#FutureTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#DeepTech hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#StartupLife hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#BigData hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#InnovationLeadership hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#EmergingTech hashtag#Build hashtag#HODL hashtag#CryptoCommunity hashtag#Web3Development hashtag#BlockchainDevelopment

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor? What was your experience? Please leave a comment.hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Trust hashtag#Ethics hashtag#Legitimacy

Kyle ChristensenKyle Christensen,,"Hey Network: We're Hiring! Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities. The candidate will be a mid- to senior level individual contributor and will be leaned on to mentor and coach more junior developers. Bonus points if this person has QA experience. Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards. (As a reference point: I recently moved into my current role as a Solution Manager from Microsoft and didn't see a significant difference in Pay / Benefits). If you're not a good fit, but you know someone who is, please encourage them to apply... and send me a DM if they/you do apply so I can watch in the system.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

Luís MonteiroLuís Monteiro,,"Knowing ≠ Owning: Let’s Respect the Line Between Backend and DevOpsTwo days ago, I had a backend developer interview. All was going well until this question popped up:“If the CPU is at 100% due to requests, how would you add more iron?”“Iron” — meaning more RAM? More cores? More instances? They didn’t clarify. But more importantly — why is that my call as a backend developer?Let’s get something straight:Backend developers build the core logic, APIs, database interactions.DevOps engineers manage infrastructure, scaling, deployments, and monitoring.They’re different roles.They require different expertise.They’re both crucial — but they’re not interchangeable.Yes, it's great when a backend dev understands infrastructure. It’s even better when a DevOps engineer understands the app they're deploying. That kind of collaboration is gold.But understanding isn’t the same as owning.And expecting backend engineers to fully manage cloud infrastructure, Terraform configs, Kubernetes clusters — on top of building robust backend systems — is crossing a line.It’s okay to ask if a candidate is familiar with DevOps concepts.But it’s not okay to expect backend developers to perform full DevOps duties by default.Let’s respect specialization. Let’s foster cross-functional knowledge without collapsing roles into each other. And let’s build teams where collaboration replaces unrealistic expectations.hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechRoles hashtag#EngineeringCulture hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DeveloperCommunity hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#RecruiterTips hashtag#WorkplaceRealTalk hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TeamworkInTech

Ben AmosBen Amos,,"Job seekers, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the age of AI, we must do our due diligence.In my hunt for work, I came across a job posting for a DevOps Engineer role with a company called Mercor that I found particularly interesting. I will share with you some highlights from the posting:> ""Candidates who pass the interview and join the project will receive a $150 bonus, in addition to hourly compensation for the project.""Neat. FYI, Mercor's website lists compensation at $55-60 per hour.> ""The project has a 2 week trial period up front to see if it’s a good mutual fit, and will extend beyond that based on performance.""Key word: performance. Translation: Be prepared to be let go at any time for any reason?> ""The application process is very simple: upload your resume, immediately take a 45-minute long interview (no wait), and then wait to hear back from us!""Wow! That sounds so much better than the vast majority of job interview processes out there today? Alright, what's the catch?> ""You’ll be paid weekly via Stripe Connect. You’ll be an independent contractor, working through Mercor.""Okay, so it's gig work. Good to know. What else?> ""The interview will take around 30-60 minutes and will be administered by Mercor AI, with an initial behavioral component followed by one technical challenge.""Aha. Translation: You must spend 30-60 minutes training our AI for us for free.So in the best of cases, this is a legitimate offer and could be a nice little side job for however long it lasts, but may not be as reliable as other gig work such as Lyft or Grubhub. In the worst case, the job posting is more-or-less fake and they're not actually hiring anyone, but they're happy to take the better part of an hour's worth of your training data and feed it to their AI, thank you and goodbye.Does anyone out there have any experience applying for this role with Mercor?

Our development team supporting Dynamics 365 Applications for BYU-Pathway is looking for an Experienced Power Platform/Dynamic 365 Dev to join our team. The selected candidate will need to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.We don't care if you've grown up with the platform from the Citizen Developer route or if you've come from the Full-Stack Developer side and learned Low-Code along the way. The ideal candidate will be someone who understands Solutioning and Application Lifecycle Management (using mostly Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines), can build Model-Driven Apps, Canvas Apps, Power Pages, and Power Automate Cloud Flows and is familiar with things like setting up Environment Variables and Tokens, can diagnose flow errors, and can extend the platform with Azure capabilities.

Contrary to popular belief, working in a church role supporting BYU-Pathway you will actually find the pay and benefits package to be quite competitive to industry standards.

Hirenkumar G.Hirenkumar G.,,"Don’t Be Afraid to Try Again: You’re Not Starting from Scratch, You’re Starting from ExperienceFailure Isn’t the End—It’s a Beginning in DisguiseLet’s be honest—failure stings. Whether it’s a certification exam you didn’t pass, a job interview that didn’t go your way, or a project that just didn’t work out the way you hoped—it’s easy to feel discouraged. But here's the truth:""Don't be afraid to try again after you have failed, because this time you're not starting from scratch—you're starting from experience.""That’s a powerful mindset shift—and one that could make all the difference on your journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer, or achieving any meaningful goal.Learning Through the StruggleThink of every failed attempt as a rehearsal. You learned something new—about the tools, the process, and most importantly, about yourself. Maybe your first try at installing Kubernetes failed. Maybe your CI/CD pipeline broke a dozen times before finally running smoothly. That’s not wasted time. That’s learning in action.In the DevOps world, failure isn’t just common—it’s expected. It’s how we build more resilient systems. The same goes for your career and personal growth.The DevOps Journey: It’s Not a Straight LineBecoming a DevOps Engineer doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a combination of learning Linux, mastering cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, scripting, understanding CI/CD, monitoring tools, and so much more. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and yes—you will make mistakes.But every retry is stronger because now you're equipped with real-world experience, not just theory.Trying again after failing is not weakness—it’s strategy.From Failure to FuelEvery rejection email, every error log, every command that doesn’t work is feedback. You now know one more way not to do it. That’s how greatness is built. The road to success is paved with ""almost made it"" moments.The difference between someone who becomes a DevOps Engineer and someone who gives up? It’s not talent. It’s not luck. It’s resilience.Let Experience Be Your LaunchpadWhether your goal is to land that DevOps job, earn a certification, start your own startup, or just become better than you were yesterday—failure isn’t the finish line. It’s a checkpoint.So, try again. Smarter this time. Stronger this time. More determined this time.You’re not starting from scratch. You’re starting from experience—and that makes all the difference.🚀 Keep Going. You Got This.hashtag#Motivation hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#FailureIsFeedback hashtag#KeepPushing hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#TryAgain hashtag#YouGotThis hashtag#SRE hashtag#AI

Tania DolzenkoTania Dolzenko,,"Got a gap on your resume? Let’s stop pretending resumes are perfect timelines. Life happens. Layoffs, caregiving, illness, burnout, sabbaticals… They’re all real, valid, and human. So why do we feel pressure to cover them up?The truth? Recruiters care more about how you talk about the gap than the gap itself. What matters is how you talk about it. Real ways to frame your story on a resume: Example 1 Career Pause | 2023–2024 Stepped back to care for a family member and earned a Google Data Analytics Certificate during that time. Example 2 Sabbatical | 2022–2023 Took time to travel, learn UX design, and completed freelance web projects for two small businesses. Example 3 Industry Transition | 2023 – Present After a layoff, I took short-term content gigs and upskilled in SEO while pivoting to marketing. Example 4 Mental Health Break | 2021–2022 Focused on well-being and volunteered for a nonprofit’s comms team, supporting outreach efforts. See the pattern? It’s not about explaining gaps; it’s about showing growth during themLet’s normalize career breaks. You don’t have to hide what makes you human. Ever had a gap you were nervous to share?

Siva Kumar K.Siva Kumar K.,,"🎯 How This Strategy Helped Me Land Interviews at Top Companies like Amazon, TikTok, CommVault, Align, and multiple recruiter reach-outs for niche roles.As a CS grad student, I’ve realized that landing the right opportunity takes more than just applying. It’s about being strategic, timely, and intentional in how you show up-both on paper and online. Here’s the approach I’m following:🔹 1. Define Target RolesFocus on 3–5 job titles that align with your skills (e.g., Software Engineer, AI/ML Intern, Full Stack Dev). For each one, I maintain a customized resume that reflects the role’s specific requirements and language.💡 To do this efficiently, I maintain an overall master resume (~10 pages) that documents everything I’ve worked on-from projects and internships to research and leadership. When applying, I use GPT to help tailor the content, selecting only the most relevant points that fit the job description.🔹 2. Build a Target Company ListShortlist 15–30 companies based on growth, alignment with your interests, and hiring potential. For each one:• Follow their LinkedIn page• Engage meaningfully with posts-add value, don’t just comment for visibility• Reach out to alumni, engineers, or recruiters for A.I.R. (Advice, Insights, Recommendations), not just job asks🔹 3. Apply Within 48 HoursApply within the first 48 hours of a job posting. Your chances of getting shortlisted drop significantly afterward.⏳ If the posting is older? I prioritize getting a referral over applying directly.🔹 4. Build a Recruiter-Friendly LinkedIn ProfileYour profile should reflect the value you offer at a glance:• Use a clear, impact-driven headline (not just ""Student at XYZ"")• Add a detailed About section that communicates your skills, interests, and goals• Keep your Featured section updated with resumes, projects, or blog posts• Highlight results, not just responsibilities, in your Experience section💡 If you notice a recruiter or tech lead viewing your profile, don’t hesitate to reach out with a message or connection request. A short, genuine note can turn passive interest into a valuable conversation.🔹 5. Be Flexible, Stay ConsistentStay open to adjacent roles (e.g., Analyst, DevOps ) and keep track of your progress. Follow up, send thank-you notes, and stay accountable.It’s not just about how many jobs you apply to-it’s about how effectively you position yourself, build meaningful connections, and follow through with intent. If you’re a fellow grad student navigating this challenging market, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to exchange ideas, share templates, or have a quick conversation to help however I can.hashtag#JobSearchStrategy hashtag#GraduateStudent hashtag#EarlyCareer hashtag#LinkedInTips hashtag#Networking hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#InternshipSearch hashtag#Referrals hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#CSJobs hashtag#TechCareers

Luís MonteiroLuís Monteiro,,"Knowing ≠ Owning: Let’s Respect the Line Between Backend and DevOpsTwo days ago, I had a backend developer interview. All was going well until this question popped up:“If the CPU is at 100% due to requests, how would you add more iron?”“Iron” — meaning more RAM? More cores? More instances? They didn’t clarify. But more importantly — why is that my call as a backend developer?Let’s get something straight:Backend developers build the core logic, APIs, database interactions.DevOps engineers manage infrastructure, scaling, deployments, and monitoring.They’re different roles.They require different expertise.They’re both crucial — but they’re not interchangeable.Yes, it's great when a backend dev understands infrastructure. It’s even better when a DevOps engineer understands the app they're deploying. That kind of collaboration is gold.But understanding isn’t the same as owning.And expecting backend engineers to fully manage cloud infrastructure, Terraform configs, Kubernetes clusters — on top of building robust backend systems — is crossing a line.It’s okay to ask if a candidate is familiar with DevOps concepts.But it’s not okay to expect backend developers to perform full DevOps duties by default.Let’s respect specialization. Let’s foster cross-functional knowledge without collapsing roles into each other.
