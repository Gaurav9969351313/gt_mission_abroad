Literally.Yesterday, I visited the e& Store (EASE) at Dubai Mall—and it is unlike anything I have seen in the GCC retail landscape.This is not just a digital twist on a telecom store. It is a reimagined retail environment built for speed, data, and human experience.What stood out to me:Biometric/ FastPass access – no phones, no queues. Just walk in.AI-powered smart shelving & autonomous checkout – zero friction.Trade-in machines – seamless upgrade path, no human needed.Facial recognition SIM activation – onboard tourists in seconds.Self-assisted purchase & delivery stations – shop here, receive anywhere.Deep digital integration – loyalty, payments, and analytics in one loop.As someone who helps reshaping retail assets within the region, I see this as a clear benchmark. It signals where the region is headed: From transactional to experiential. From staffed to autonomous. From square meters to smart meters.Big respect to e& UAE for raising the bar.What are the most futuristic retail formats you have experienced recently—and how close are our retail properties to catching up?

It is a reimagined retail environment built for speed, data, and human experience.What stood out to me:Biometric/ FastPass access – no phones, no queues. Just walk in.AI-powered smart shelving & autonomous checkout – zero friction.Trade-in machines – seamless upgrade path, no human needed.Facial recognition SIM activation – onboard tourists in seconds.Self-assisted purchase & delivery stations – shop here, receive anywhere.Deep digital integration – loyalty, payments, and analytics in one loop.As someone who helps reshaping retail assets within the region, I see this as a clear benchmark. It signals where the region is headed: From transactional to experiential. From staffed to autonomous.

It is a reimagined retail environment built for speed, data, and human experience.What stood out to me:Biometric/ FastPass access – no phones, no queues. Just walk in.AI-powered smart shelving & autonomous checkout – zero friction.Trade-in machines – seamless upgrade path, no human needed.Facial recognition SIM activation – onboard tourists in seconds.Self-assisted purchase & delivery stations – shop here, receive anywhere.Deep digital integration – loyalty, payments, and analytics in one loop.As someone who helps reshaping retail assets within the region, I see this as a clear benchmark. It signals where the region is headed: From transactional to experiential. From staffed to autonomous.
