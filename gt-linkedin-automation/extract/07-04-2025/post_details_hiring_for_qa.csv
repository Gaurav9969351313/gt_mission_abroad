Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial.

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔

Aryan TandonAryan Tandon,,"I can’t believe the strategy of this game development company🤯Gaming is a billion-dollar industry, but hype alone doesn’t build success. Here’s a deep dive into how a development studio went from massive investment to tough layoffs👇It was set out to create a ""Made-in-India"" battle royale with global ambitions. The vision was strong, but the execution? Not so much.💰$10M+ invested, but a significant portion went into marketing, branding, and partnerships rather than actual game development.⚡Marketing Blitz – The company spent over ₹25L for Instagram promotions. Massive social media campaigns and influencer collaborations to built hype. 🤑 Expensive hiring practices – Offering ₹12LPA to fresh graduates when they could have hired more experienced developers for the same budget. →This led to talent gaps in crucial areas like game mechanics, optimization, and server stability.The project wasn’t just about making a great game—it became more about selling the dream. But when it came time to deliver, cracks started showing.🔹Marketing over Game Development – Instead of investing in refining gameplay and ensuring a polished experience, more focus was put on social media buzz, influencer partnerships, and PR stunts. 🔹High burn rate – The company overspent on branding, PR, and flashy hires, leading to unsustainable operations. 🔹No strategic execution – A strong brand can’t carry a weak product. They miscalculated their revenue model and struggled. Without a strong retention strategy, even the best marketing can’t save a game.When revenue didn’t meet expectations, the studio had to make difficult choices to survive:📉 One-third of the workforce laid off – Around 45 employees have already been let go65555. Entire teams, including the entire QA department, were reportedly dismissed.💸 Restructuring to cut losses – The leadership admitted they ""miscalculated"" and had to restructure teams to focus on core priorities.💔 Employee morale & community trust shaken – Layoffs always hurt, but when they follow high spending and poor planning, they leave a bigger impact on the studio’s reputation, employee trust, and community perception.Being a co-founder of a esports organization, I can hardly see why we should invest in Indus Esports scenario: ✅ Build first, promote later. Hype doesn’t fix a weak product. Focus on gameplay, user experience, and core mechanics before investing heavily in marketing.✅ Invest wisely, not blindly – A balanced budget across development, marketing, and retention is crucial. Bad marketing investments drain resources. ✅ Right people doing market research result in Better decisions – Having strong market research teams and decision-makers can prevent expensive mistakes and ensure a game’s success.The gaming industry is unforgiving—mistakes are costly, and only those who adapt and prioritize player experience survive. 🎮The real question is, can *Super Gaming’s Indus Battle Royale* bounce back? 🤔
