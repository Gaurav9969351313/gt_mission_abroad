Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.

Dato’ Dr. Munirah LooiDato’ Dr. Munirah Looi,,"Thank you Max Amies and hashtag#Boomi for the invite and sharing. It was indeed a very engaging networking session.Key take-aways:- While Malaysia is seeing strong individual adoption of AI (especially Generative AI), its enterprise AI adoption (8.1%) is lower than Indonesia (24.6%) and Thailand (17.1%).- Several key factors contribute to this gap: --> Limited AI Integration in Business Operations: Many Malaysian businesses still view AI as an optional tool rather than a core driver of efficiency and innovation. SMEs make up 97.4% of Malaysia’s businesses, but many lack the resources and expertise to implement AI. For Mid-Large companies, Legacy Systems & Infrastructure – Many companies still rely on outdated IT systems, making AI integration complex and costly.--> Data Challenges & Governance Restrictions: AI relies on large datasets for training, but Malaysia faces several obstacles: (a) Limited Data Sharing – Many companies hoard data rather than participate in open data ecosystems; (b) Regulatory Barriers – The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) restricts how businesses collect and process consumer data, making AI training more difficult; (c) Lack of High-Quality Labeled Data – AI models require well-structured datasets, which are scarce in Malaysia.--> High AI Implementation Costs & ROI Concerns: Many Malaysian businesses hesitate to invest in AI due to high costs and uncertain return on investment (ROI). (a) Talent Costs – Hiring AI specialists is expensive, and Malaysia faces a talent shortage; (b)Computing Power & Infrastructure – AI models require high-performance computing (HPC), which many companies lack; (c) Long Payback Period – Many businesses worry AI investments won’t yield immediate results, leading to cautious adoption.How Malaysia Can Accelerate Enterprise AI Adoption:While the Malaysian government has implemented several initiatives to regulate and promote AI, we need to move faster if Malaysia wants to be a Regional Leader in AI Innovation:1. Government-Led Incentives – Expand AI funding, tax breaks, and grants for AI implementation in SMEs.2. Data Sharing & Governance – Develop policies that balance data privacy with AI innovation, similar to Singapore.3. AI Upskilling & Retention – Invest in training programs and offer competitive incentives to keep AI talent in Malaysia.4.	Industry-Specific AI Use Cases – Showcase real-world success stories to encourage adoption in traditional industries.hashtag#mydigitalcorp hashtag#naio hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#digitaleconomy hashtag#ai Roger Bendrien AHMAD IKHWAN MOHD ROZALI Chan Kah Woo Ts.
