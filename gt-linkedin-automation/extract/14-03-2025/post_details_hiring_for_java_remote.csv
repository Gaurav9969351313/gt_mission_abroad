Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape?

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation. How are you protecting yourself against such threat landscape? Will you choose some other path?ISACA ISACA Melbourne Chapter ISC2 Australian Information Security Association (AISA) ACS (Australian Computer Society) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Cybersecurity Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Vinyl SVinyl S,,"Cybersecurity hashtag#Community Post #3- Protecting your  Java Applications. Desired hashtag#Audience:Cybersecurity Architects , hashtag#Appsecurity engineers & Application Development Programmers. Why Java hashtag#deserialisation still attracts so many vulnerabilities and security issues?Understanding the issue:1. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 says Java - widely used language-30.3% of developers reporting using it.2. 45 billion Java Virtual Machines globally.Every instance uses serialisation -deserialisation but why ?Without serialization & deserialization, even the most revolutionary program, poised to reshape the world, remains trapped. Network transmission of programs is not possible, and the ability to persist object states from memory to disk—for later recovery—vanishes. In layman's term, Imagine if you want to drive Tesla in Mars, in all excitement you do put Tesla in a SpaceX spacecraft to hashtag#Mars but when you accelerate the Tesla, use its autopilot and other fancy features in Mars, you find the safest car on earth is behaving rather dangerously in Mars. Reason being the recalibration of all essential functions , hashtag#security validations, new essential features required for Mars, was not done. Java Serialisation and deserialisation works the same. It is trying to recreate the same object that was created by developer but in  some  new  unknown destination and expecting it run as safe as in the original developer environment. In technical terms, the flaws lie in following a) bypassing of constructors while deserialising which were essential for object's security validation & security conditioning.b) bypassing the object's accessibility model, even if your object is private or final, breaking the data trust c) recursively reconstructs the object and leverages backref and many more .Java's deserialization flaws are consistently exploited, even in well-written code. This is a language-level problem, not a developer problem.To know in detail about each of these flaws, this video is enlightening https://lnkd.in/gfSE5wMTWhat can be done: a) We as developers can do our best by following the coding best practice & keep our fingers crossed. b) Have a security runtime mechanism to check every deserialiased object is behaving correctly. No malicious process forking, No malicious access to private and final fields, no malicious chains of method calls, No object injections, no remote code execution, No privilege escalation. Please note, EDRs fail against these specific Java deserialised based exploits, you need to leverage true Runtime Adaptive Self protection platforms of your respective organisation.

David MilmineDavid Milmine,,"How far would you travel to work? Candidate ProfileRole Criteria 1: Electrician ✅Role Criteria 2: Sales experience ✅Nice to have: Estimator ✅Happy to relocate, partners business can be done remotely. ✅Interview goes well and it seems like there are complimentary personalities and interest from the candidate in the business and the role.Dealbreaker: Family don’t want to relocate. ❌Mitigating Circumstance: Candidate drives 1.5 hours to work and enjoys driving. Happy to do 1 week on-site and 1 week remote with low cost local accommodation and cover fuel. He’s done something similar for two years straight previously, and due to a change in circumstances could relocate from early 2026. 😊 ✅Clients thinks it will be too hard to make work and worries it’s not sustainable long term. ❌I hear and understand both sides in this and sometimes different perspectives don’t come together to an agreement that works. And there’s no hard feelings from any party in all of this.Learnings/Reflections: Here’s three reflections and learnings for me from this process.1 If considering relocating: Job seekers, if you can get your family onboard with a move prior to an interview, recruiters and hiring managers the world over will love you for it. I realize people want to explore an opportunity before they give full commitment to making a move too, it’s often a chicken and egg situation. I encourage early conversations on this prior to an interview if possible to see if a move is viable for all people who a move would affect.2 Remote/WFH Stances: My general impression with remote working has been that there’s three camps. A) We don’t do remote or WFH.B) We do full or partial remote or WFH options.C) Here’s the interesting one for me – We don’t do remote for new staff. But we may consider remote or WFH for existing staff… Why? I think it’s because when you know and trust a person and know the results they can deliver for your business, even when remote work isn’t your norm, many businesses are more likely to make an exception for a current valued employee. They know what they may lose if they don’t make the exception. This versus a new hire where the focus goes onto the reasons it may not work, there’s no relationship, trust, experience of results etc. I personally went from in-office to fully remote with my last employer and worked quite happily fully remote for 2.5 years before setting up PeopleLogic. And I’m still fully WFH. It works for some and not for others. Takeaway for people not sure if their employer would let them work remote or WFH – ask the question and find out!3 Commute Preferences vary wildly: Many people wouldn’t want to commit to the level of driving that this candidate is happy with doing but we had a robust discussion on this and it’s not a thing to this person. Learning: I’m still wary of long commutes but each person’s appetite for a commute is different!hashtag#PeopleLogicNZ

Matt JonesMatt Jones,,"I’m playing a little game called ‘build a cool business.’ 😉One I would personally want to work with. But what actually makes a business cool? For me it’s things like✅ A fun culture✅ A positive culture✅ A culture where people feel like they belongThat can be tricky when you’re working remotely. No coffee machine convos. No Friday drinks. No casual “Hey, got a sec?” chats.So how can you keep a good culture alive?That was one of my biggest questions when building Independent Agent NZReal estate can feel like a lone-wolf game. but I didn’t want that for our team.So we built a system where you can work remotely without feeling isolated.Here’s some ways we’re doing it….⚡️ Virtual coffee mornings (because everyone needs a good excuse to step away from emails)⚡️ Online sales meetings (keeping everyone in sync, minus the awkward boardroom energy)⚡️ In-person events (because some things are better not on Zoom)Remote work isn’t just about flexibility. It’s about being part of something, without giving up your independence.The best teams have your back, whether you’re in an office or working from a beach.We’re always experimenting and seeing what works. If you’re working remotely…what’s the thing that keeps you connected?Would love to hear what’s worked for you...Matt________P.S If you want to find out more about us and how we work, get in touch. We're a friendly bunch and don't bite. Got some great people joining Independent Agent NZ (check it out) and creating greater freedom for themselves. Feel free to DM me.
