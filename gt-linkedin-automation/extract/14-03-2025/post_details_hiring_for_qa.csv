Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Hena PayghamHena Paygham,,"As a foreign journalist living in the U.S., I’ve noticed that breaking into American newsrooms is incredibly challenging. Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals. Have you faced similar challenges, or do you know of organizations that value international perspectives in their newsrooms?

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Hena PayghamHena Paygham,,"As a foreign journalist living in the U.S., I’ve noticed that breaking into American newsrooms is incredibly challenging. Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

Sarah Nicole SaenzSarah Nicole Saenz,,"Being part of Information Technology Students of America (ITSA) has been such a rewarding experience. As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us!

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us!

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Alsu TarzimanovAlsu Tarzimanov,,"This is a great reminder to never give up, lose your hope, overreact or put your hands down in challenging situations.Sometimes, the obstacles we face are just part of the process, and it's important to trust that steady progress will lead to great results. 😉 However, I stumbled upon this quote last night and realized how applicable it is to our professional lives as well.In the pursuit of excellence, sometimes it's not about rushing for quick results but focusing on quality over speed.Just like rockets and Rome weren't built in a day... 🤝  ... in Recruiting: defining the right role within your organization and finding that perfect fit takes some time;📟 ... the Accounting team may take a little longer to finalize the quarterly reports, but the attention to detail ensures accuracy that can save the company from future financial missteps;📝  ... similarly, Compliance team may require some extra time to review policies, but that thorough process ensures the organization stays ahead of potential risks;🦾 ... for Product and development, it may mean spending an extra couple of weeks testing before launching a product, but that diligence often translates into years (maybe even longer) of solid, unbreakable performance.So today I just want to embrace the moments that encourage stable quality over quantity or speed as a priority 🚀✨🙂 P.S.: And, of course, there are moments when you do need to act fast…like when the coffee machine breaks down on a Monday morning!  hashtag#TrustTheProcess hashtag#QualityOverSpeed hashtag#QuoteOfTheDay

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

It's not an appeal — it's a legal review of how the decision was made. ⏳ ACT QUICKLY, DEADLINES ARE TIGHT📍 Inside Canada: 15 days to apply 🌍 Outside Canada: 60 days to act ⚠ No appeal after an unsuccessful JR — so legal expertise and careful preparation are critical.WHEN IS A ""JR"" POTENTIALLY THE RIGHT MOVE? ❌ The officer ignored key documents. ❌ The refusal lacks an explanation. ❌ There wasn't a fair chance to provide missing information. ❌ The decision misapplied immigration law.STEPS IN THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS1️⃣ Consultation: Seek legal advice to discuss if JR is the right approach.2️⃣ Obtain Officer’s Notes: These notes (arrive in 4–6 weeks) explain why the case was refused. 3️⃣ Legal Arguments: Must be submitted to the court within 30 days of receiving the notes. 4️⃣ Review Process: A settlement may speed things up, but full decisions take 3–5 months. 5️⃣ Final Decision: If ""leave"" is granted, the case goes to a hearing. 👍 Outcome: If successful, the case is reconsidered by a different immigration officer, but approval isn’t guaranteed.WE'RE HERE TO HELP📌 RCICs: Unsure if a refusal can be challenged? Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up. Get trusted legal advice starting with a complimentary initial consultation.*Our Federal Court practice also includes mandamus applications (for excessive IRCC processing delays) and applications for stay of removal.hashtag#ImmigrationLaw hashtag#WorkInCanada hashtag#StudyInCanada hashtag#ImmigrationLawyer hashtag#CanadianImmigration hashtag#RCIC hashtag#ImmigrationConversation hashtag#GertlerLaw

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Alsu TarzimanovAlsu Tarzimanov,,"This is a great reminder to never give up, lose your hope, overreact or put your hands down in challenging situations.Sometimes, the obstacles we face are just part of the process, and it's important to trust that steady progress will lead to great results. 😉 However, I stumbled upon this quote last night and realized how applicable it is to our professional lives as well.In the pursuit of excellence, sometimes it's not about rushing for quick results but focusing on quality over speed.Just like rockets and Rome weren't built in a day... 🤝  ... in Recruiting: defining the right role within your organization and finding that perfect fit takes some time;📟 ... the Accounting team may take a little longer to finalize the quarterly reports, but the attention to detail ensures accuracy that can save the company from future financial missteps;📝  ... similarly, Compliance team may require some extra time to review policies, but that thorough process ensures the organization stays ahead of potential risks;🦾 ... for Product and development, it may mean spending an extra couple of weeks testing before launching a product, but that diligence often translates into years (maybe even longer) of solid, unbreakable performance.So today I just want to embrace the moments that encourage stable quality over quantity or speed as a priority 🚀✨🙂 P.S.: And, of course, there are moments when you do need to act fast…like when the coffee machine breaks down on a Monday morning!  hashtag#TrustTheProcess hashtag#QualityOverSpeed hashtag#QuoteOfTheDay

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Alsu TarzimanovAlsu Tarzimanov,,"This is a great reminder to never give up, lose your hope, overreact or put your hands down in challenging situations.Sometimes, the obstacles we face are just part of the process, and it's important to trust that steady progress will lead to great results. 😉 However, I stumbled upon this quote last night and realized how applicable it is to our professional lives as well.In the pursuit of excellence, sometimes it's not about rushing for quick results but focusing on quality over speed.Just like rockets and Rome weren't built in a day... 🤝  ... in Recruiting: defining the right role within your organization and finding that perfect fit takes some time;📟 ... the Accounting team may take a little longer to finalize the quarterly reports, but the attention to detail ensures accuracy that can save the company from future financial missteps;📝  ... similarly, Compliance team may require some extra time to review policies, but that thorough process ensures the organization stays ahead of potential risks;🦾 ... for Product and development, it may mean spending an extra couple of weeks testing before launching a product, but that diligence often translates into years (maybe even longer) of solid, unbreakable performance.So today I just want to embrace the moments that encourage stable quality over quantity or speed as a priority 🚀✨🙂 P.S.: And, of course, there are moments when you do need to act fast…like when the coffee machine breaks down on a Monday morning!  hashtag#TrustTheProcess hashtag#QualityOverSpeed hashtag#QuoteOfTheDay

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Alsu TarzimanovAlsu Tarzimanov,,"This is a great reminder to never give up, lose your hope, overreact or put your hands down in challenging situations.Sometimes, the obstacles we face are just part of the process, and it's important to trust that steady progress will lead to great results. 😉 However, I stumbled upon this quote last night and realized how applicable it is to our professional lives as well.In the pursuit of excellence, sometimes it's not about rushing for quick results but focusing on quality over speed.Just like rockets and Rome weren't built in a day... 🤝  ... in Recruiting: defining the right role within your organization and finding that perfect fit takes some time;📟 ... the Accounting team may take a little longer to finalize the quarterly reports, but the attention to detail ensures accuracy that can save the company from future financial missteps;📝  ... similarly, Compliance team may require some extra time to review policies, but that thorough process ensures the organization stays ahead of potential risks;🦾 ... for Product and development, it may mean spending an extra couple of weeks testing before launching a product, but that diligence often translates into years (maybe even longer) of solid, unbreakable performance.So today I just want to embrace the moments that encourage stable quality over quantity or speed as a priority 🚀✨🙂 P.S.: And, of course, there are moments when you do need to act fast…like when the coffee machine breaks down on a Monday morning!  hashtag#TrustTheProcess hashtag#QualityOverSpeed hashtag#QuoteOfTheDay

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Robert GertlerRobert Gertler,,"📜𝗝𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗻𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗹𝘀🍁 Judicial Review (JR) at Canada's Federal Court allows immigration applicants to challenge unreasonable or procedurally unfair refusals. It's not an appeal — it's a legal review of how the decision was made. ⏳ ACT QUICKLY, DEADLINES ARE TIGHT📍 Inside Canada: 15 days to apply 🌍 Outside Canada: 60 days to act ⚠ No appeal after an unsuccessful JR — so legal expertise and careful preparation are critical.WHEN IS A ""JR"" POTENTIALLY THE RIGHT MOVE? ❌ The officer ignored key documents. ❌ The refusal lacks an explanation. ❌ There wasn't a fair chance to provide missing information. ❌ The decision misapplied immigration law.STEPS IN THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS1️⃣ Consultation: Seek legal advice to discuss if JR is the right approach.2️⃣ Obtain Officer’s Notes: These notes (arrive in 4–6 weeks) explain why the case was refused. 3️⃣ Legal Arguments: Must be submitted to the court within 30 days of receiving the notes. 4️⃣ Review Process: A settlement may speed things up, but full decisions take 3–5 months. 5️⃣ Final Decision: If ""leave"" is granted, the case goes to a hearing. 👍 Outcome: If successful, the case is reconsidered by a different immigration officer, but approval isn’t guaranteed.WE'RE HERE TO HELP📌 RCICs: Unsure if a refusal can be challenged? Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up. Get trusted legal advice starting with a complimentary initial consultation.*Our Federal Court practice also includes mandamus applications (for excessive IRCC processing delays) and applications for stay of removal.hashtag#ImmigrationLaw hashtag#WorkInCanada hashtag#StudyInCanada hashtag#ImmigrationLawyer hashtag#CanadianImmigration hashtag#RCIC hashtag#ImmigrationConversation hashtag#GertlerLaw

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

It's not an appeal — it's a legal review of how the decision was made. ⏳ ACT QUICKLY, DEADLINES ARE TIGHT📍 Inside Canada: 15 days to apply 🌍 Outside Canada: 60 days to act ⚠ No appeal after an unsuccessful JR — so legal expertise and careful preparation are critical.WHEN IS A ""JR"" POTENTIALLY THE RIGHT MOVE? ❌ The officer ignored key documents. ❌ The refusal lacks an explanation. ❌ There wasn't a fair chance to provide missing information. ❌ The decision misapplied immigration law.STEPS IN THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS1️⃣ Consultation: Seek legal advice to discuss if JR is the right approach.2️⃣ Obtain Officer’s Notes: These notes (arrive in 4–6 weeks) explain why the case was refused. 3️⃣ Legal Arguments: Must be submitted to the court within 30 days of receiving the notes. 4️⃣ Review Process: A settlement may speed things up, but full decisions take 3–5 months. 5️⃣ Final Decision: If ""leave"" is granted, the case goes to a hearing. 👍 Outcome: If successful, the case is reconsidered by a different immigration officer, but approval isn’t guaranteed.WE'RE HERE TO HELP📌 RCICs: Unsure if a refusal can be challenged?

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

It's not an appeal — it's a legal review of how the decision was made. ⏳ ACT QUICKLY, DEADLINES ARE TIGHT📍 Inside Canada: 15 days to apply 🌍 Outside Canada: 60 days to act ⚠ No appeal after an unsuccessful JR — so legal expertise and careful preparation are critical.WHEN IS A ""JR"" POTENTIALLY THE RIGHT MOVE? ❌ The officer ignored key documents. ❌ The refusal lacks an explanation. ❌ There wasn't a fair chance to provide missing information. ❌ The decision misapplied immigration law.STEPS IN THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS1️⃣ Consultation: Seek legal advice to discuss if JR is the right approach.2️⃣ Obtain Officer’s Notes: These notes (arrive in 4–6 weeks) explain why the case was refused. 3️⃣ Legal Arguments: Must be submitted to the court within 30 days of receiving the notes. 4️⃣ Review Process: A settlement may speed things up, but full decisions take 3–5 months. 5️⃣ Final Decision: If ""leave"" is granted, the case goes to a hearing. 👍 Outcome: If successful, the case is reconsidered by a different immigration officer, but approval isn’t guaranteed.WE'RE HERE TO HELP📌 RCICs: Unsure if a refusal can be challenged? Let’s discuss your client’s case. You can always DM me -- right here or Gertler Law Office. More contact info via our website.⬇️  📌 Individuals: If you receive an IRCC refusal letter, don't give up. Get trusted legal advice starting with a complimentary initial consultation.*Our Federal Court practice also includes mandamus applications (for excessive IRCC processing delays) and applications for stay of removal.hashtag#ImmigrationLaw hashtag#WorkInCanada hashtag#StudyInCanada hashtag#ImmigrationLawyer hashtag#CanadianImmigration hashtag#RCIC hashtag#ImmigrationConversation hashtag#GertlerLaw

There is a need for an enduring ""regions-up"" system across the State of California that further institutionalizes hashtag#regional approaches to decision-making and funding while better aligning planning efforts in hashtag#economicdevelopment, hashtag#landuse, hashtag#housing, hashtag#transportation, and hashtag#climateresilience.What are the reckonings? - Key investments like hashtag#CAJobsFirst through California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) will end in 2026 unless there is ongoing funding or a decision to institutionalize an enduring hashtag#state and hashtag#regional hashtag#economicdevelopment structure. - Regional planning agencies represented by California Association of Councils of Governments (CALCOG) have called for a comprehensive reevaluation of the the state's landmark hashtag#regionalplanning law hashtag#SB375. - hashtag#California’s regions face increasing hashtag#climaterisk, but hashtag#climateresilience is not sufficiently incorporated into existing plans.- The hashtag#federal government is undergoing significant restructuring and will likely shrink place-based investments, including in hashtag#climate and hashtag#economicdevelopment activities. This will require not only the State of California, but also every hashtag#region, to consider filling the gap.Pleased to share the outline of our hashtag#RegionsUp agenda and to be part of this important work with colleagues and partners at California Forward, the California Stewardship Network, as well as other regional leaders.

Salil MehendaleSalil Mehendale,,"Turning Trade Threats into Opportunity: Canada’s Business Migration AdvantageU.S. trade threats such as talk of making Canada the ‘51st state’ and heavy tariffs have Canadians feeling “under economic attack” . Yet Canada can turn these challenges into opportunities by leveraging business migration.Global Entrepreneurs Fuel GrowthCanada attracts global talent, entrepreneurs, and investors who drive the economy . New businesses drive job creation, and immigrant entrepreneurs play an outsized role – accounting for 34.7% of Canada’s early-stage entrepreneurs . Their companies tend to grow faster, create more jobs, and often expand into global markets .Attracting Global Talent & InvestmentTo turn threats into opportunities, Canada can double down on policies that welcome innovators, founders and investors: •	Streamlined entrepreneur visas: The Start-up Visa offers permanent residency to founders launching companies , spurring startups, jobs and innovation. •	Fast-track talent pathways: Expedited visas for skilled professionals and a welcoming immigration system attract top talent. •	Supportive business climate: Incentives (tax breaks, R&D support) and global market access make Canada an attractive base for businesses.Business migrants boost innovation and resilience by bringing ideas, investing capital, and helping Canadian firms reach new markets. By broadening our economic base, Canada becomes less dependent on any one partner and more agile amid global changes. Canada’s answer to these threats is to embrace growth and talent from everywhere. Welcoming business migration turns challenges into catalysts for a stronger, more innovative economy.hashtag#Canada hashtag#Economy hashtag#Trade hashtag#Immigration hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Investment hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#JobCreation hashtag#EconomicResilience

Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Benje PattersonBenje Patterson,,"The ASB Regional Scorecard highlighted that Otago is New Zealand’s number one performing region at present. What makes the ASB Scorecard result more impressive is that within Otago, we have Queenstown Lakes growing strongly, while Dunedin is currently in recession.It’s great to see another piece of economic analysis demonstrating our region’s value proposition to the rest of New Zealand. The Otago Central Lakes regional deal proposal, recently put forward by Queenstown Lakes and its neighbour Central Otago, emphasises the long-term sustained growth occurring within Inland Otago.The Otago Central Lakes regional deal is a great opportunity for New Zealand. While much of the rest of the country is in recession, we already know that Otago Central Lakes is continuing to grow the New Zealand economy and inertia alone will add billions to New Zealand’s GDP in the decade to come. However, with the help of a regional deal, Otago Central Lakes could:- Add billions more to New Zealand’s GDP if the right infrastructure and services were in place to enable higher productivity activity to flourish.- Act as a shopfront for broader NZ Inc trade and investment opportunities to the rest of the world (1 in 3 international travellers to New Zealand pass through Queenstown alone).- Be a testbed for trialling new regional models that can be rolled out to other regions.Queenstown Lakes District Council Central Otago District Council Destination Queenstown Inc Technology Queenstown Limited University of Otago Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit Department of Internal Affairs (NZ) New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Invest New Zealand The Treasury - New Zealand Tourism New Zealand Glyn Lewers Tamah Alley Peter Harris Nick Lanham Sharon Fifield Tracey Roxburgh Otago Daily TimesASB Scorecard available here: https://lnkd.in/gDCn_i9n

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Egon TerplanEgon Terplan,,"There is significant and renewed interest in hashtag#regionalism - but the regionalism 'movement' faces key reckonings. There is a need for an enduring ""regions-up"" system across the State of California that further institutionalizes hashtag#regional approaches to decision-making and funding while better aligning planning efforts in hashtag#economicdevelopment, hashtag#landuse, hashtag#housing, hashtag#transportation, and hashtag#climateresilience.What are the reckonings? - Key investments like hashtag#CAJobsFirst through California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) will end in 2026 unless there is ongoing funding or a decision to institutionalize an enduring hashtag#state and hashtag#regional hashtag#economicdevelopment structure. - Regional planning agencies represented by California Association of Councils of Governments (CALCOG) have called for a comprehensive reevaluation of the the state's landmark hashtag#regionalplanning law hashtag#SB375. - hashtag#California’s regions face increasing hashtag#climaterisk, but hashtag#climateresilience is not sufficiently incorporated into existing plans.- The hashtag#federal government is undergoing significant restructuring and will likely shrink place-based investments, including in hashtag#climate and hashtag#economicdevelopment activities. This will require not only the State of California, but also every hashtag#region, to consider filling the gap.Pleased to share the outline of our hashtag#RegionsUp agenda and to be part of this important work with colleagues and partners at California Forward, the California Stewardship Network, as well as other regional leaders.
