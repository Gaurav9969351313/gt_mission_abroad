"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”
