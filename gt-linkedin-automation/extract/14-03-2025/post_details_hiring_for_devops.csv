You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Sarah Nicole SaenzSarah Nicole Saenz,,"Being part of Information Technology Students of America (ITSA) has been such a rewarding experience. As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Sarah Nicole SaenzSarah Nicole Saenz,,"Being part of Information Technology Students of America (ITSA) has been such a rewarding experience. As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up.

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Sarah Nicole SaenzSarah Nicole Saenz,,"Being part of Information Technology Students of America (ITSA) has been such a rewarding experience. As Secretary, I’ve seen how much effort our members put into creating opportunities for students to learn, connect, and grow. But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain? Are they the missing piece for mainstream adoption?

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary?

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean. If you’re in a position to help—whether through sponsorship, mentorship, or even just sharing advice—we’d love to connect. Every bit of support makes a difference!hashtag#StudentLeadership hashtag#FundingChallenges hashtag#supportstudents hashtag#ITSAThe University of Texas Rio Grande Valley UTRGV Robert C.

"Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.Lauren Villanueva, Ed.D.",,"Christina M. Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects. I’d love to hear how you’re leveraging AI in your workflow—let’s share ideas!hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#AI hashtag#Coding hashtag#TechRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#DeveloperTools hashtag#Refactoring hashtag#Programming hashtag#RustLang hashtag#PineScript hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Automation hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#DataVisualization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CodeQuality hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TechnicalHiring hashtag#CodingLife

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

But one thing i have also learned, is how funding can be a real challenge.We have BIG ideas and the drive to make them happen, but sometimes the resources just aren’t there. Still, we don't give up. We’re getting creative, leaning on the support of those who believe in what we do, and doing everything we can to keep providing value to our members.I must say though, fundraising today was so much fun!If you’ve ever been part of a student org, you know how much these experiences mean.

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

Smith, Ed.D. and I are delighted to have co-authored an article for the March-April 2025 edition of Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Currents magazine, which makes the “Case for Compassion in Talent Management.”We brought together the findings of our individual research studies on employee retention in higher education advancement to propose a framework for human-centered talent management that aims to promote joy and flourishing in the workplace.It is our hope that we can inspire other advancement leaders to adopt a whole-person approach to talent management—that is grounded in empathy and seeks to understand how employees’ needs, interests, and motivations—both in their personal and professional lives—influence their job-related decisions and experiences within organizations.A big thanks to our editor, Meredith Barnett and her team at CASE for their guidance in preparing this piece. And, a shout out to Anna Schlia ☀️ the fearless leader of Advancement Pracademics group. Christina and I might not have ever connected had it not been for your vision in bringing our little community to life! Please check out our article and share your feedback with us! Christina and I are eager to hear what you think and how you might apply this to your organization.

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”

Shopica VenkataramananShopica Venkataramanan,,"🚀 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): The Secret Vaults of Computing! 🔐Imagine you have a 📖 diary full of secrets. You don’t want anyone—even your closest friends—to peek inside. What if you could write and read from it without ever exposing the pages? 🤯That’s what TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) do for computing! 🔒✨💡 A TEE is like a secure vault inside your computer’s processor 🏰. It ensures that even if the system is compromised, your sensitive data and computations remain private and untouchable. 🔐💎But why does this matter for blockchain? 🤔🔹 Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts 🤫🔗 – TEEs enable confidential transactions, meaning data can be processed without revealing sensitive details. 🔹 Scalability & Speed ⚡🚀 – Instead of executing everything on-chain (slow & costly ⏳💰), some computations happen securely in a TEE, making blockchain apps faster & more efficient. 🔹 Decentralized Identity & Security 🆔🔒 – TEEs help store private keys securely, reducing risks of hacks & leaks.💥 Why is this revolutionary? Blockchain is transparent, but sometimes, we need privacy without compromising trust. TEEs bring the best of both worlds—confidentiality + verifiability—paving the way for secure DeFi, private NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. 🌍💡The future of blockchain isn’t just decentralization—it’s secure, scalable, and private decentralization! 🚀🔥What do you think about TEEs in blockchain?

José C. FloresJosé C. Flores,,"I just wrapped up a fun experiment using AI to visualize my codebase as an interactive graph! The goal is to quickly spot dependencies, highlight potential dead code, and anticipate the blast radius of future refactors. The screenshot shows how each component connects, helping me zero in on areas that need cleanup or could cause ripple effects if I change them. An automated “bird’s-eye view” like this keeps large projects cleaner, more modular, and easier to test.In parallel, I’ve been updating my pine-script-syntax extension with a Rust-based linter (coming soon!), which will make static analysis and error detection even more precise. Harnessing AI-driven insights like these is a big step toward smoothly maintaining and scaling complex projects.

"Joahna Rocchio, PhDJoahna Rocchio, PhD",,"🗓️⚖️🎓 Very cool. Application deadline has passed, but it’s such a great idea for law schools to offer this kind of a pre-grad program; it’s a wise way to address the common cultural/social capital disadvantages that affect first-Gen university students—disadvantages that play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality from generation to generation and the underrepresentation of minorities in places of power. I’m posting this past the application deadline in hopes that the same program exists next year and/or it inspires those who might be interested in it to look for similar pre-law one-year or one-summer programs elsewhere. It’d also be nice if law schools (and other grad programs) that don’t currently offer such pre-grad short(er)-courses/programs begin doing so.Relatedly: See the comments on this post for a book on preparing to be a law student LexisNexis recently advertised to me. Looks good. It’s a legal studies book that’s actually affordable too!“The Future Leaders in Law Program is a yearlong pre-law initiative that brings together individuals with a range of lived experiences, primarily individuals from first-generation and less advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. This yearlong program begins with a weeklong residential fellowship at Harvard Law School (HLS) that helps prepare participants to apply for admission to law schools nationwide.This program is fully funded, with all costs covered to participate, including transportation, lodging, and preparation materials.  We will provide need-based assistance for law school application fees, LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) reports, and the LSAT administration.  In addition, a $3,000 stipend will be awarded upon successful program completion.”
