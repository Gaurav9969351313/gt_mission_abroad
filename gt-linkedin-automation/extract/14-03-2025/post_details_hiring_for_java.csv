They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people.

We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

Lipika ShettyLipika Shetty,,"When hiring, it’s easy to focus on what’s missing - the “must-haves” that aren’t quite there. But what if we flipped the lens? What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people. If we always focus on what’s there instead of what’s missing, we open the door to incredible talent.hashtag#weploystories hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruitmentstories hashtag#smarthiring hashtag#talentacquisitiontips

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected.

Hena PayghamHena Paygham,,"As a foreign journalist living in the U.S., I’ve noticed that breaking into American newsrooms is incredibly challenging. Many news organizations seem hesitant to hire non-citizen reporters, even when they have the necessary work authorizat ion and relevant experience with bachelor's/master's degree in Journalism & Mass Communication.Why do American news channels rarely offer opportunities to foreign journalists living in the U.S.? Is it due to work visa complexities, industry preferences, or something else?I’d love to hear insights from fellow journalists, hiring managers, and media professionals.

What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people.

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Lipika ShettyLipika Shetty,,"When hiring, it’s easy to focus on what’s missing - the “must-haves” that aren’t quite there. But what if we flipped the lens? What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people. If we always focus on what’s there instead of what’s missing, we open the door to incredible talent.hashtag#weploystories hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruitmentstories hashtag#smarthiring hashtag#talentacquisitiontips

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Lipika ShettyLipika Shetty,,"When hiring, it’s easy to focus on what’s missing - the “must-haves” that aren’t quite there. But what if we flipped the lens? What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people. If we always focus on what’s there instead of what’s missing, we open the door to incredible talent.hashtag#weploystories hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruitmentstories hashtag#smarthiring hashtag#talentacquisitiontips

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

"Chantilly jobs, VirginiaChantilly jobs, Virginia",,"hashtag#hiring *Sr. Software Engineer - 10% 401k - FS Poly with Security Clearance*, Chantilly, *United States*, fulltime hashtag#opentowork hashtag#Chantillyjobs hashtag#Virginiajobs hashtag#ITCommunications*To Apply -->*: https://lnkd.in/difSfRjV In a space where it is hard to be unique, our client is a VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY. The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people.

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people. If we always focus on what’s there instead of what’s missing, we open the door to incredible talent.hashtag#weploystories hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruitmentstories hashtag#smarthiring hashtag#talentacquisitiontips

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

"Chantilly jobs, VirginiaChantilly jobs, Virginia",,"hashtag#hiring *Sr. Software Engineer - 10% 401k - FS Poly with Security Clearance*, Chantilly, *United States*, fulltime hashtag#opentowork hashtag#Chantillyjobs hashtag#Virginiajobs hashtag#ITCommunications*To Apply -->*: https://lnkd.in/difSfRjV In a space where it is hard to be unique, our client is a VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY. The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Scammers can do the following major things with you.* They can take and use your personal information for any sort of purpose.* They can ask you for money to invest for the job you have to do, be aware of those who asks you for money. They one who wants you to do the job would never ask you for any sort of money because they’ll be the one paying for what you do for them and not actually be paying them to hire you or invest yours.* Scammers can be the one who make you do the work and don’t pay you the wage.There can be even more kind of scams. So to all the freshers especially who are new to the field, be aware of any sort of those scams as it’ll only give you either emotional, psychological and financial lose. How to avoid the Scams?*Look for the ones who hire you who have decent amount of followers, or check for their history. Take careful steps and follow their details in order to understand their business etc. * Never pay anyone to get you hired, because that is beneficial for only them and is never going to work for you.* When you’re hired and you have done the work. Show them the proof of not all the work but the basics to ensure them that you have done your part and ask for the half of the price before you send them their work. Be careful and be wise when you take the steps towards your goals and objectives. Like every other field, only jobs have many threats as well. Do study everything before you go for any deals.

What if we focused on what a candidate brings, rather than what they don’t? 🤔 This week, we kicked off hiring for 13 brand-new roles in a fresh division for one of our leading clients. They didn’t just want to find people - they wanted to build a strong, capable team. And because they trusted the process, we moved quickly, engaged top talent, and secured the right candidates without unnecessary roadblocks.The best hiring processes are:👉 Simple & effective - No endless interviews, just smart, focused decision-making.👉 Candidate-first - Respect their time, and they’ll respect your role.👉 Built on trust - When clients trust the process, they attract top talent faster.At the end of the day, hiring is about finding the right people. If we always focus on what’s there instead of what’s missing, we open the door to incredible talent.hashtag#weploystories hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruitmentstories hashtag#smarthiring hashtag#talentacquisitiontips

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Wayne McDonaldWayne McDonald,,"The Real Value in Recruitment: It’s Not Just About FeesYesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a client contact about how their business defines ""value"" in recruitment. The business shifted their attention to lowest fee percentage (8 months ago). Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth

Mariam SpiliotiMariam Spilioti,,"HORROR STORY!....Just got off the phone with a skilled professional I’ve known for years. We’ve kept in touch regularly - I’ve offered him market insights, job search support, and a genuine interest in his career.During our chat, he told me about another candidate currently looking for work, and let me tell you… he’s had a week from hell.He was working with a recruiter who sent him to a meeting with a client…Only to arrive and be told: “We weren’t expecting you... and that role’s already been filled.”Days later, the same recruiter sent him to the wrong address, which made him show up late to the actual meeting, to then find out… the role the client was speaking about was completely different from what the candidate was looking for. Let me be clear: This isn’t how recruitment should be done.We are here to represent both candidates and clients.We should be communicating clearly, confirming meetings, and aligning expectations.We should not be sending people out blindly.Candidates deserve respect. Clients deserve professionalism.To every candidate out there: please know NOT ALL recruiters operate this way. And to those of us in the industry: do better.

Marcus KohMarcus Koh,,"Why Recruiters Don't Call Back.Ever sent your resume into the recruitment void, only to hear...nothing? That silence isn't just frustrating - it's mystifying.Here's the inside story.1. We forgetPicture this: A recruiter scanning hundreds of profiles, juggling phone calls with candidates, updating clients, rushing to meetings, and trying to document everything at once. Some days, our follow-up messages get buried under an avalanche of tasks. Not an excuse, but the honest reality of our chaotic days.2. We have no news""Any news on my application?"" you ask. Sometimes we wonder the same thing! Many clients go silent for weeks, leaving us empty-handed when you reach out. We wish we had updates to share.3. We can't fit you at the momentIf you're not a fit for current roles, you join our ""future talent"" database. We work to fill specific client needs - they're the ones paying our bills. But when something perfect crosses our desk? You'll be our first call.4. We can't figure you outThose unexplained gaps in your resume? The 5 jobs in 3 years? That vague description of what you actually do? These things make us hesitate. Part of our job is spotting potential red flags before our clients do.5. We struggle with uncomfortable truthsSometimes, the feedback is awkward to deliver. A client might pass on you because of something said in an informal reference check or how you presented yourself (read: personal appearance). These conversations are difficult to navigate without someone getting hurt.We genuinely feel bad when communications drop. You deserve better, and the good recruiters know it.What's been your experience with recruitment communication? Has silence left you questioning your candidacy?hashtag#recruitment hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#positivelinksasia

Jenna WahlstroemJenna Wahlstroem,,"Traditional recruitment often heavily emphasises past job titles, years of experience, and specific skills listed on resumes. I've noticed that focusing too much on the past can sometimes limit our view of a candidate's true potential. After all, we are recruiting for the future! ➡️ I believe that a growth mindset, a positive attitude, and a passion for learning are just as valuable. While some roles do have very specific requirements and previous experience is necessary, other roles can and should be more open to non-traditional backgrounds with transferable skills.Although, Gemini's picture suggestion for this post highlights that sometimes past experience is extremely crucial. For example, I wouldn’t go rock climbing with just a harness and no rope! 😂 I hope she has a can-do attitude..Happy Friday!

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research, and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need engineers with a TS/SCI + FS Poly in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage. It's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. They are seeking a Sr. Software Engineer to join their team. Relevant qualifications: -Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or similar -8+ years of professional experience -Experience with Java, JavaScript, and Python -Experience with Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, NiFi, and RabbitMQ -Experience with building and deploying cloud infrastructure (CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet) -Experience building APIs (REST, Hadoop, Spark) or automation (Jenkins, Maven) or monitoring technologies (ELK, Grafana, Prometheus) This role is located in Chantilly, VA and requires a TS/SCI + FS Polygraph.

"Ron Auerbach, MBARon Auerbach, MBA",,"The hashtag#TodayShow this morning had a segment about hashtag#ghosting. It focused on why job seekers don't hear back from hashtag#employers after hashtag#interviews. So often times, you're left hanging as to what's going on, which really frustrates those seeking employment! The same thing applies when applying for work. One thing that was left out, yet is a big reason for why this happens, is this. The hashtag#GreatRecession led many hashtag#companies to reduce HR departments to basically skeleton crews. A radical change from human resource departments being immune from hashtag#jobcuts! So with this reduction in HR staff, there's been an increase in job seekers being left hanging rather than getting responses. Thus, hashtag#businesses focused more on HR departments as hashtag#costcenters rather than being hashtag#profitcenters. And to save hashtag#money, they gutted human resources! Something that pretty much remains to this day as the departments continue to be ""lean and mean."" So responding to job hunters, unless they're being advanced to the next round or being given a hashtag#joboffer, is extremely low on the priority list. Does this stink from a job seeker's perspective? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝘁! And we literally have  two hashtag#generations who don't remember the days when you had received an acknowledgement of applying and being rejected. Thus hashtag#millenials and hashtag#genz have basically grown up with being left hanging! hashtag#jobapplicant hashtag#jobcandidate hashtag#jobcandidates hashtag#jobapplicants hashtag#candidate hashtag#applicant hashtag#applicants hashtag#candidates hashtag#job hashtag#jobs hashtag#newhire hashtag#newhires hashtag#recruiter hashtag#hiringmanger hashtag#employer hashtag#employers hashtag#recruiters hashtag#hiringmangers hashtag#jobinterview hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviews hashtag#interview hashtag#interviewing hashtag#interviewprep hashtag#interviewpreparation hashtag#interviewquestions hashtag#interviewtip hashtag#interviewtips hashtag#interviewexperience hashtag#interviewprocess hashtag#decision hashtag#decisions hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringdecisions hashtag#applyingforajob hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#jobhunting hashtag#employment hashtag#hiring hashtag#recruiting hashtag#employability hashtag#recruitment hashtag#jobseeking hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#careeradvise hashtag#careeradvice hashtag#careeradvising hashtag#careercoaching hashtag#careercounseling hashtag#careerguidance hashtag#success hashtag#tips hashtag#questions hashtag#questionanswering hashtag#humanresources hashtag#HR hashtag#ronauerbach hashtag#ronauerbachmba Ron Auerbach, MBA hashtag#ARCSeattle

Since then, this contact has been trying to hire a significant, strategically important technical hire to deal with their growing pipeline of projects (and he and his team have become overwhelmed with the workload).But is the fee percentage really where the biggest value lies?What often gets overlooked is the opportunity cost—the impact of hiring the right person sooner rather than later.Every extra week a role remains vacant means:• Lost productivity• Stretched teams covering the gap• Missed revenue opportunities• Increased risk of a rushed, poor hireThe right recruitment partner doesn’t just fill a seat. We find the best person faster, ensuring your business moves forward, not stalls. And when you factor in the cost of delays or a mis-hire, the ""cheapest"" option may actually be the most expensive mistake.True value isn’t just in saving on fees—it’s in securing the right talent at the right time to drive your business forward.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you define value in recruitment?hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpportunityCost hashtag#BusinessGrowth
