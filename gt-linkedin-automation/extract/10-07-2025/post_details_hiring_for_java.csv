Satyam TiwariSatyam Tiwari,satyamtiwari07860@gmail.com,"🚨 Actively Looking for Opportunities | Software Development 🚨Hello LinkedIn network,I hope you're doing well. I'm currently seeking a job opportunity in the field of Software Development.I have 1.6 years of hands-on experience in backend development using Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and I'm also familiar with tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other modern backend technologies. In addition to my development experience, I have a strong passion for problem solving—I consistently enjoy breaking down complex challenges into scalable, maintainable solutions.I had to leave my previous role at the end of November 2024 due to a family medical emergency, which required my full attention. Since then, I’ve been actively preparing and participating in multiple interviews. Despite clearing several interview rounds, I unfortunately haven’t received any final offers yet.To stay sharp and continue growing during this time, I’ve also been upskilling myself in modern backend technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and exploring emerging fields like Generative AI. This period has been challenging—both personally and financially—and I’m now focused on rebuilding stability while advancing my career.I’m truly passionate about building robust backend systems and contributing to impactful products.
