Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Molly ZhangMolly Zhang,,"For the past few months, I’ve been working a part-time, non-technical job to pay the bills while continuing my job search. But if I’m being honest, I miss coding. I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product. If you’re a startup founder looking for technical support or a company hiring contract developers, let’s chat! If you know of any opportunities, feel free to reach out or tag someone who might be interested. Excited to get back to building!  🫡

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Molly ZhangMolly Zhang,,"For the past few months, I’ve been working a part-time, non-technical job to pay the bills while continuing my job search. But if I’m being honest, I miss coding. I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product. If you’re a startup founder looking for technical support or a company hiring contract developers, let’s chat! If you know of any opportunities, feel free to reach out or tag someone who might be interested. Excited to get back to building!  🫡

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries.

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Molly ZhangMolly Zhang,,"For the past few months, I’ve been working a part-time, non-technical job to pay the bills while continuing my job search. But if I’m being honest, I miss coding. I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product.

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Vijeta RajaneVijeta Rajane,,"Day16-16MarchFortune Cloud Technologies Private Limited 👁️‍🗨️ What is Devops ?---DevOps is a combination of ""Development"" and ""Operations."" It's a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies aimed at improving the collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, releasing, and managing software to deliver faster, more reliable updates and improvements.🎯 Key Goals of DevOps:✅ Faster delivery – Automating processes to shorten the software development lifecycle. ✅ Higher quality – Reducing bugs and improving software reliability. ✅ Better collaboration – Breaking down silos between developers and operations teams. ✅ Increased automation – Automating repetitive tasks to reduce errors and increase efficiency. ✅ Continuous improvement – Using feedback to improve processes and products.🌍 Why DevOps Matters1. Faster Delivery: Continuous deployment means you can release code multiple times a day.2. Improved Quality: Automated testing and monitoring catch bugs early.3 .Better Team Collaboration: No more blaming between development and operations teams.4. Cost Reduction: Automation reduces manual effort and human error.5. Scalability: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for rapid scaling.🚀 DevOps Life Cycle (Short Summary)The DevOps lifecycle includes 8 key stages that form a continuous loop:1️⃣ Plan – Define project requirements and goals.2️⃣ Develop – Write and manage code using version control.3️⃣ Build – Compile and package the code.4️⃣ Test – Run automated tests to check for bugs and errors.5️⃣ Release – Prepare and approve code for deployment.6️⃣ Deploy – Automate code deployment to production.7️⃣ Operate – Manage and monitor applications and infrastructure.8️⃣ Monitor – Continuously track performance and issues.DevOps = Faster Releases + Better Quality + Happier Teams 😎Fortune Cloud Technologies Private Limitedhashtag#devops hashtag#aws hashtag#docker hashtag#kubernets hashtag#jenkins hashtag#cloud hashtag#tools hashtag#fortunecloud

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Molly ZhangMolly Zhang,,"For the past few months, I’ve been working a part-time, non-technical job to pay the bills while continuing my job search. But if I’m being honest, I miss coding. I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product. If you’re a startup founder looking for technical support or a company hiring contract developers, let’s chat!

Kedar S.Kedar S.,,"🚀 Unlocking the Power of DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub & Terraform 🔍🔥DevOps & SRE engineers are the backbone of modern IT operations. But how do tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform fuel business success? More importantly, can we measure their ROI? Let’s dive in! 💡🚀 Key Business Use Cases✅ Docker: Enables containerization, ensuring consistent app deployment across environments. ✅ Kubernetes: Automates container orchestration, scaling, and management. ✅ GitHub: Enhances collaboration, version control, and CI/CD workflows. ✅ Terraform: Empowers infrastructure as code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.💡 Importance for DevOps & SRE EngineersThese tools streamline workflows, improve reliability, and boost automation. They reduce human errors, enhance security, and ensure faster delivery cycles—essential for modern software development.🔍 Measuring ROI of DevOps Tools & Engineer EffortsHow do you justify the investment? Measure: ✅ Deployment Speed: Reduction in time-to-market. ✅ Incident Resolution Time: Faster recovery from failures. ✅ Operational Costs: Efficiency gains in cloud & infra spending. ✅ Security & Compliance: Improved governance and reduced vulnerabilities.🔥 Lessons Learned🔹 Adoption must be strategic—rushing without proper governance can backfire. 🔹 Skill development is crucial; undertrained engineers can hinder adoption. 🔹 Continuous monitoring of tool effectiveness ensures long-term gains.💰 Business Benefits & Engineer Productivity🚀 Faster go-to-market with CI/CD & automated deployments. 🔍 Cost savings through optimized cloud usage. 💡 Increased reliability with proactive monitoring & auto-healing infra. ✅ Higher developer efficiency with standardized workflows.🌍 Cloud Agnostic or Cloud Dependent?Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Terraform are largely cloud-agnostic 🌐, but their implementation can be tailored for specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Engineers should prioritize multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.📚 Best Learning Resources & DocumentationDocker Documentation: https://docs.docker.comGitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.comTerraform Documentation: https://lnkd.in/dGp-UHPMKubernetes Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docsEmbrace DevOps excellence—empower engineers, optimize tools, and drive measurable business impact! 💡🚀hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Terraform hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automation hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics

Vijeta RajaneVijeta Rajane,,"Day16-16MarchFortune Cloud Technologies Private Limited 👁️‍🗨️ What is Devops ?---DevOps is a combination of ""Development"" and ""Operations."" It's a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies aimed at improving the collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, releasing, and managing software to deliver faster, more reliable updates and improvements.🎯 Key Goals of DevOps:✅ Faster delivery – Automating processes to shorten the software development lifecycle. ✅ Higher quality – Reducing bugs and improving software reliability. ✅ Better collaboration – Breaking down silos between developers and operations teams. ✅ Increased automation – Automating repetitive tasks to reduce errors and increase efficiency. ✅ Continuous improvement – Using feedback to improve processes and products.🌍 Why DevOps Matters1. Faster Delivery: Continuous deployment means you can release code multiple times a day.2. Improved Quality: Automated testing and monitoring catch bugs early.3 .Better Team Collaboration: No more blaming between development and operations teams.4. Cost Reduction: Automation reduces manual effort and human error.5. Scalability: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for rapid scaling.🚀 DevOps Life Cycle (Short Summary)The DevOps lifecycle includes 8 key stages that form a continuous loop:1️⃣ Plan – Define project requirements and goals.2️⃣ Develop – Write and manage code using version control.3️⃣ Build – Compile and package the code.4️⃣ Test – Run automated tests to check for bugs and errors.5️⃣ Release – Prepare and approve code for deployment.6️⃣ Deploy – Automate code deployment to production.7️⃣ Operate – Manage and monitor applications and infrastructure.8️⃣ Monitor – Continuously track performance and issues.DevOps = Faster Releases + Better Quality + Happier Teams 😎Fortune Cloud Technologies Private Limitedhashtag#devops hashtag#aws hashtag#docker hashtag#kubernets hashtag#jenkins hashtag#cloud hashtag#tools hashtag#fortunecloud

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out.

Ashira PitchayapakayakulAshira Pitchayapakayakul,,"Title: Transform Your Software Delivery with DevOps AutomationAre you looking to streamline your development process, reduce risk, and ship software faster? DevOps automation can accelerate your release cycle and free you up to focus on the strategic parts of your job. Let’s explore the details, the practical “how-to,” the pros and cons, and some ideas for continuous improvement.1. What Is DevOps Automation? DevOps automation involves using scripts and specialized tools to handle repetitive tasks—such as code integration, testing, and deployment—so that your team can focus on more complex, value-added work. From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure-as-code, automating these pieces helps create a reliable and scalable process.2. How to Implement DevOps Automation • Choose Your Tools: Pick a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions based on your team’s familiarity and project requirements. • Containerize Applications: Use Docker or Kubernetes to standardize environments, making deployments and rollbacks consistent. • Automate Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into your pipeline to catch issues early. • Infrastructure-as-Code: Manage your infrastructure through tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for repeatable provisioning. • Monitoring & Alerting: Leverage solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to receive real-time insights into application performance and automate the escalation process for issues.3. Pros & Cons of DevOps Automation • Pros:  – Faster Time to Market: Automated pipelines support rapid releases, helping you deliver new features to customers sooner.  – Reduced Human Error: Scripts and standardized processes minimize manual mistakes and misconfigurations.  – Consistency & Reliability: Reproducible builds and deployments maintain consistent environments across staging and production. • Cons:  – Initial Setup Complexity: Building automated pipelines requires time, expertise, and alignment on tools and standards.  – Maintenance Overhead: Automation scripts and pipelines need continuous upkeep to accommodate new code, dependencies, and security patches.  – Skill Gaps: Not all team members may be familiar with automation tools; training or hiring specialized talent might be needed.4. Tips for Continuous Improvement • Review & Update Pipelines: Regularly revisit your pipeline configurations to remove outdated scripts or add new integrations. • Shift Security Left: Integrate security scans early in the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before they reach production. • Embrace Observability: Track key metrics
