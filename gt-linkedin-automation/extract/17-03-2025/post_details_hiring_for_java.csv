It's a frustrating cycle that can leave graduates feeling defeated and uncertain about their future, all the excitement of finishing school disappears😔.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position. Things like understanding the culture and values of a company are important too.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position. Things like understanding the culture and values of a company are important too.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts! Is low-code/no-code the future of IAM?🚀 hashtag#IAM hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#Saviynt hashtag#SailPointIdentitySecurityCloud hashtag#Cybersecurity

One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts! Is low-code/no-code the future of IAM?🚀 hashtag#IAM hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#Saviynt hashtag#SailPointIdentitySecurityCloud hashtag#Cybersecurity

One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts!

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts!

It's a frustrating cycle that can leave graduates feeling defeated and uncertain about their future, all the excitement of finishing school disappears😔.

Of couse they looking by candidates that can match so much as possible the requirements asked for the role or job, but sometimes, what can be a game changer is your attitude or behaviour in an interview in front of the interviewer especially if that person is the team leader or the responsible by the position. One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position. Things like understanding the culture and values of a company are important too.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts!

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts!

This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts! Is low-code/no-code the future of IAM?🚀 hashtag#IAM hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#Saviynt hashtag#SailPointIdentitySecurityCloud hashtag#Cybersecurity

One of the questions that you should be prepared to answer is why do you think you are able to work for that position.

Ahmed AbdelGhafarAhmed AbdelGhafar,,"Why I Believe Saviynt Will Surpass SailPoint Identity Security Cloud as the Leading Cloud Identity Solution:As someone who has been part of both Saviynt and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud implementations, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and advantages of each platform. While both are positioned as cloud identity solutions, Saviynt's low-code/no-code approach gives it a decisive edge. Here’s why:✅ Lower Skill Barrier & Hiring Costs: SailPoint Identity Security Cloud still requires engineers with strong programming skills (Java, BeanShell, etc.), making implementations dependent on highly specialized talent. Finding and hiring such resources is expensive, and the learning curve is steep. Saviynt, on the other hand, leverages low-code/no-code configurations, reducing reliance on hard-to-find developers and making it easier for IAM teams to manage without deep coding expertise.✅ Simplified Deployment & Faster Time-to-Value: Saviynt’s low-code UI-driven workflows significantly reduce deployment complexity compared to SailPoint Identity Security Cloud, where custom rules and scripts can add time and effort. This means businesses can get up and running faster, with fewer headaches, and lower implementation costs.✅ Cost Efficiency & Scalability: With Saviynt’s low-code approach, companies spend less on implementation and ongoing maintenance. Fewer specialized developers are required, reducing overall costs. This makes it a more scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for enterprises looking to optimize IAM operations without inflating their budgets.✅ Reduced Complexity & Operational Overhead: The more custom code an IAM solution requires, the harder it becomes to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot. SailPoint Identity Security Cloud’s reliance on custom scripting adds complexity, while Saviynt’s configuration-driven model ensures easier updates, better maintainability, and fewer breakpoints over time.At the end of the day, the IAM space is shifting toward simplified, efficient, and cost-effective solutions. While SailPoint Identity Security Cloud remains a strong player, the demand for low-code/no-code identity management is growing—and that’s exactly why Saviynt is set to overtake it in the cloud IAM space.Would love to hear your thoughts!

Unfortunately, their platform has some limitations like some jobs don’t provide salary details.
