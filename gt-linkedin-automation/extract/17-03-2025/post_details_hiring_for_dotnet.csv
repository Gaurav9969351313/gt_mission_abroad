Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Job rejections can be tough, but remember:🔹 Rejection doesn’t define your worth. 🔹 Every “no” brings you closer to the right “yes.” 🔹 Growth happens in the struggle—keep learning, keep improving.Success isn’t about never failing; it’s about never giving up. Stay patient, stay persistent, and trust that your opportunity is on its way. 🚀Your hard work will pay off.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Job rejections can be tough, but remember:🔹 Rejection doesn’t define your worth. 🔹 Every “no” brings you closer to the right “yes.” 🔹 Growth happens in the struggle—keep learning, keep improving.Success isn’t about never failing; it’s about never giving up. Stay patient, stay persistent, and trust that your opportunity is on its way. 🚀Your hard work will pay off.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Why Use async and await?Keeps the UI responsive Improves performance by not blocking threads Simplifies code structure 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: async makes the function asynchronous. await tells the program to wait for the operation without blocking the thread. HttpClient fetches data from a URL asynchronously. Common Mistakes to Avoid: Forgetting await can cause unexpected behavior. Blocking async calls with .Result or .Wait() can lead to deadlocks.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold. Right strategy + persistence = Success! 🔥If you’ve had a similar job search experience, share it in the comments! 👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#LinkedInNetworking hashtag#JobSwitch

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

However, you can effectively invalidate or expire tokens on logout using the following strategies:1️⃣ Short-Lived Access TokensEffect: Token expires automatically after a short time.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Most applications.2️⃣ Delete Token from CookiesEffect: Token becomes inaccessible after logout.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Web apps using HttpOnly cookies.3️⃣ Blacklist Tokens in MemoryEffect: Token is manually blocked on logout.Storage Needed: Yes (e.g., Redis or MemoryCache).Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Apps that require immediate token revocation.4️⃣ Use Custom Claim (Token Versioning)Effect: Token becomes invalid when a stored token ID is revoked.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Stateless APIs needing token validation.5️⃣ Rotate and Revoke Refresh TokensEffect: Prevents users from getting a new access token after logout.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Secure API authentication using refresh tokens.⏳ 1. Use Short-Lived Access Tokens (Best Practice)This is the simplest and most effective approach:Issue short-lived access tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes).On logout, delete the refresh token, preventing users from getting a new access token.🔹 Set Token Expiry (Short-Lived Token)📌 Now, after logout, the token will expire soon.🍪 2. Store Token in HttpOnly Cookies & Delete on LogoutIf you store the JWT in HttpOnly cookies, you can delete the cookie on logout, making the token inaccessible.🔹 Store Token in Cookie🔹 Delete Cookie on Logout📌 Now, the user cannot send requests with the old token.🔒 3. Blacklist Tokens in Memory (Immediate Expiry)To immediately revoke a JWT, store it in an in-memory blacklist (e.g., Redis, MemoryCache) and reject it on future requests.🔹 Store Revoked Tokens in Memory🔹 Block Blacklisted Tokens in Middleware📌 Now, blacklisted tokens will be rejected immediately!To Be Continued...

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold. Right strategy + persistence = Success! 🔥If you’ve had a similar job search experience, share it in the comments! 👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#LinkedInNetworking hashtag#JobSwitch

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 01 :- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core? Since JWTs are stateless, they cannot be modified or deleted once issued. However, you can effectively invalidate or expire tokens on logout using the following strategies:1️⃣ Short-Lived Access TokensEffect: Token expires automatically after a short time.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Most applications.2️⃣ Delete Token from CookiesEffect: Token becomes inaccessible after logout.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Web apps using HttpOnly cookies.3️⃣ Blacklist Tokens in MemoryEffect: Token is manually blocked on logout.Storage Needed: Yes (e.g., Redis or MemoryCache).Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Apps that require immediate token revocation.4️⃣ Use Custom Claim (Token Versioning)Effect: Token becomes invalid when a stored token ID is revoked.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Stateless APIs needing token validation.5️⃣ Rotate and Revoke Refresh TokensEffect: Prevents users from getting a new access token after logout.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Secure API authentication using refresh tokens.⏳ 1. Use Short-Lived Access Tokens (Best Practice)This is the simplest and most effective approach:Issue short-lived access tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes).On logout, delete the refresh token, preventing users from getting a new access token.🔹 Set Token Expiry (Short-Lived Token)📌 Now, after logout, the token will expire soon.🍪 2. Store Token in HttpOnly Cookies & Delete on LogoutIf you store the JWT in HttpOnly cookies, you can delete the cookie on logout, making the token inaccessible.🔹 Store Token in Cookie🔹 Delete Cookie on Logout📌 Now, the user cannot send requests with the old token.🔒 3. Blacklist Tokens in Memory (Immediate Expiry)To immediately revoke a JWT, store it in an in-memory blacklist (e.g., Redis, MemoryCache) and reject it on future requests.🔹 Store Revoked Tokens in Memory🔹 Block Blacklisted Tokens in Middleware📌 Now, blacklisted tokens will be rejected immediately!To Be Continued...

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Job rejections can be tough, but remember:🔹 Rejection doesn’t define your worth. 🔹 Every “no” brings you closer to the right “yes.” 🔹 Growth happens in the struggle—keep learning, keep improving.Success isn’t about never failing; it’s about never giving up. Stay patient, stay persistent, and trust that your opportunity is on its way. 🚀Your hard work will pay off.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Why Use async and await?Keeps the UI responsive Improves performance by not blocking threads Simplifies code structure 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: async makes the function asynchronous. await tells the program to wait for the operation without blocking the thread. HttpClient fetches data from a URL asynchronously. Common Mistakes to Avoid: Forgetting await can cause unexpected behavior. Blocking async calls with .Result or .Wait() can lead to deadlocks.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold. Right strategy + persistence = Success! 🔥If you’ve had a similar job search experience, share it in the comments! 👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#LinkedInNetworking hashtag#JobSwitch

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 01 :- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core? Since JWTs are stateless, they cannot be modified or deleted once issued. However, you can effectively invalidate or expire tokens on logout using the following strategies:1️⃣ Short-Lived Access TokensEffect: Token expires automatically after a short time.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Most applications.2️⃣ Delete Token from CookiesEffect: Token becomes inaccessible after logout.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Web apps using HttpOnly cookies.3️⃣ Blacklist Tokens in MemoryEffect: Token is manually blocked on logout.Storage Needed: Yes (e.g., Redis or MemoryCache).Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Apps that require immediate token revocation.4️⃣ Use Custom Claim (Token Versioning)Effect: Token becomes invalid when a stored token ID is revoked.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Stateless APIs needing token validation.5️⃣ Rotate and Revoke Refresh TokensEffect: Prevents users from getting a new access token after logout.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Secure API authentication using refresh tokens.⏳ 1. Use Short-Lived Access Tokens (Best Practice)This is the simplest and most effective approach:Issue short-lived access tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes).On logout, delete the refresh token, preventing users from getting a new access token.🔹 Set Token Expiry (Short-Lived Token)📌 Now, after logout, the token will expire soon.🍪 2. Store Token in HttpOnly Cookies & Delete on LogoutIf you store the JWT in HttpOnly cookies, you can delete the cookie on logout, making the token inaccessible.🔹 Store Token in Cookie🔹 Delete Cookie on Logout📌 Now, the user cannot send requests with the old token.🔒 3. Blacklist Tokens in Memory (Immediate Expiry)To immediately revoke a JWT, store it in an in-memory blacklist (e.g., Redis, MemoryCache) and reject it on future requests.🔹 Store Revoked Tokens in Memory🔹 Block Blacklisted Tokens in Middleware📌 Now, blacklisted tokens will be rejected immediately!To Be Continued...

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Job rejections can be tough, but remember:🔹 Rejection doesn’t define your worth. 🔹 Every “no” brings you closer to the right “yes.” 🔹 Growth happens in the struggle—keep learning, keep improving.Success isn’t about never failing; it’s about never giving up. Stay patient, stay persistent, and trust that your opportunity is on its way. 🚀Your hard work will pay off.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Why Use async and await?Keeps the UI responsive Improves performance by not blocking threads Simplifies code structure 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: async makes the function asynchronous. await tells the program to wait for the operation without blocking the thread. HttpClient fetches data from a URL asynchronously. Common Mistakes to Avoid: Forgetting await can cause unexpected behavior. Blocking async calls with .Result or .Wait() can lead to deadlocks.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Oleksandr BykovOleksandr Bykov,,"🌟 Question for Recruiters: How to Start a Career in Offshore Wind Energy Without Experience or Certifications?Hello, colleagues! 🌊💨Many aspiring professionals looking to enter offshore wind energy face the question: Is it possible to land a job without experience or certifications? What do you think about starting in this field as a beginner? 🤔This question is especially relevant as initial certifications (such as GWO Basic Safety Training or BOSIET) may seem expensive and out of reach for those just starting their careers. However, are there companies or programs that are willing to offer on-site training and certification or provide pathways to learning without prior experience?👉 Which companies might be a good option for beginners? Are there companies offering entry-level roles or internships that help newcomers gain experience and necessary certifications?🔑 My suggestion: If you're working in recruitment or know of companies offering such opportunities, please share in the comments! What steps should a newcomer take to break into offshore wind energy and develop their career?💬 Share your experience! What steps would you recommend for someone just starting out?

Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.

Oleksandr BykovOleksandr Bykov,,"🌟 Question for Recruiters: How to Start a Career in Offshore Wind Energy Without Experience or Certifications?Hello, colleagues! 🌊💨Many aspiring professionals looking to enter offshore wind energy face the question: Is it possible to land a job without experience or certifications? What do you think about starting in this field as a beginner? 🤔This question is especially relevant as initial certifications (such as GWO Basic Safety Training or BOSIET) may seem expensive and out of reach for those just starting their careers. However, are there companies or programs that are willing to offer on-site training and certification or provide pathways to learning without prior experience?👉 Which companies might be a good option for beginners? Are there companies offering entry-level roles or internships that help newcomers gain experience and necessary certifications?🔑 My suggestion: If you're working in recruitment or know of companies offering such opportunities, please share in the comments! What steps should a newcomer take to break into offshore wind energy and develop their career?💬 Share your experience! What steps would you recommend for someone just starting out? Which companies should be on the radar when searching for that first job in this field?hashtag#OffshoreWind hashtag#CareerStart hashtag#RenewableEnergy hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#WindEnergy hashtag#SafetyTraining hashtag#Recruitment

Job rejections can be tough, but remember:🔹 Rejection doesn’t define your worth. 🔹 Every “no” brings you closer to the right “yes.” 🔹 Growth happens in the struggle—keep learning, keep improving.Success isn’t about never failing; it’s about never giving up. Stay patient, stay persistent, and trust that your opportunity is on its way. 🚀Your hard work will pay off.

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections. Less boilerplate, more speed!hashtag#DotNET hashtag#DotNET8 hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CSharp hashtag#CodingTips

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Suvin SinghSuvin Singh,,"4 𝐌𝐚𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐌𝐞𝐢𝐧 8 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐬 – 9 𝐋𝐏𝐀 𝐬𝐞 32 𝐋𝐏𝐀 𝐓𝐚𝐤 𝐊𝐚 𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐚𝐫! 🚀🔥This post is from Reddit (not my experience, just sharing). It’s an incredible job search journey that can be useful for many.Story:An Infrastructure Engineer secured 8 job offers in just 4 months! 🚀CTC jump – 9 LPA → 32 LPA (Base) 😲Throughout the process: 600 applications, 30 recruiter calls, 25 interviews, and 8 final offers.Key Learnings:💡 Resume Matters the Most – Tailoring resumes for different roles (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Engineer) was crucial. A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold. Right strategy + persistence = Success! 🔥If you’ve had a similar job search experience, share it in the comments! 👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SRE hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#ResumeTips hashtag#LinkedInNetworking hashtag#JobSwitch

Are there companies offering entry-level roles or internships that help newcomers gain experience and necessary certifications?🔑 My suggestion: If you're working in recruitment or know of companies offering such opportunities, please share in the comments!

Mohamed AbdelazizMohamed Abdelaziz,,"دور الـ HR خلال فترة الـ Probation Periodفترة التجربة (Probation Period) دي مرحلة مهمة جدًا لأي موظف جديد في الشركة، وبتكون مدتها عادة من 3 لـ 6 شهور حسب سياسة الشركة وطبيعة الشغل. خلال الفترة دي، الـ HR بيكون ليه دور كبير في متابعة الموظف ودعمه علشان يقدر يثبت نفسه ويتأقلم مع بيئة العمل.إيه دور الـ HR خلال الـ Probation Period؟🔹 وضع التوقعات بوضوح (Setting Clear Expectations)✔️ تسليم الموظف الـ Job Description علشان يبقى عارف مسؤولياته بالظبط.✔️ تحديد معايير الأداء (Performance Metrics) اللي هيتم التقييم على أساسها.✔️ توضيح الأهداف اللي لازم يحققها خلال الفترة دي.🔹 المتابعة والتقييم المستمر (Monitoring & Performance Evaluation)✔️ عمل Check-ins دورية بين الموظف ومديره لمتابعة أدائه.✔️ تقديم تقييمات مرحلية (Mid-Probation Evaluations) علشان يوضحوا له نقاط قوته واللي محتاج يطوره.✔️ استخدام KPIs & Performance Reviews علشان يحددوا مدى تحقيقه للأهداف.🔹 التدريب والتطوير (Providing Training & Support)✔️ توفير Training Programs تساعده على تطوير مهاراته.✔️ تعيين Mentor علشان يرشده ويدعمه في التأقلم مع بيئة العمل.✔️ تقديم Constructive Feedback بشكل مستمر لتحسين أدائه.🔹 حل المشاكل والتأكد من الاندماج (Addressing Challenges & Integration)✔️ متابعة الـ Cultural Fit والتأكد إن الموظف مرتاح في بيئة العمل.✔️ حل أي مشاكل أو عقبات بتواجهه في الشغل.✔️ ضمان إنه يكون جزء من الفريق ويحس بالدعم والمساندة.🔹 اتخاذ القرار النهائي (Final Decision Making)✔️ في آخر الفترة، بيتم عمل Final Review لتقييم أداء الموظف.✔️ لو أثبت نفسه، بينتقل للتوظيف الدائم، ولو محتاج وقت إضافي ممكن يتم تمديد الفترة (Extension of Probation).✔️ ولو الأداء مش بالمستوى المطلوب، بيتم إنهاء العقد (Employment Termination) حسب سياسة الشركة.💡 الـ HR مش دوره بس يقيم الموظف خلال الـ Probation Period، لكن كمان بيساعده ويدعمه علشان ينجح. إدارة الفترة دي بشكل كويس مش بس بتحسن تجربة الموظف، لكن كمان بتقلل معدل دوران الموظفين (Turnover Rate)، وبتساعد الشركة في الاحتفاظ بالمواهب الصح! 💪🚀hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#HR hashtag#ProbationPeriod hashtag#EmployeeSuccess hashtag#futurevisionhr hashtag#تحضير_للمقابلات hashtag#توظيــــــــف hashtag#العلامة_التجارية_للتوظيف hashtag#التصميم_الوظيفي hashtag#تطوير_الموظفين hashtag#كورس_موارد_بشرية hashtag#تطوير_مهني hashtag#Future_vision hashtag#the_best_choice_for_organiziations_future hashtag#إعادة_الهيكلة hashtag#reskilling hashtag#hr hashtag#humanresources hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#كورس_موارد_بشرية hashtag#سيرة_ذاتية hashtag#موارد_بشرية

Benjeddou MonemBenjeddou Monem,,"🚀 Mastering Data Structures in .NET 8: Boost Your Code’s Performance! 🚀Are you leveraging the full power of .NET 8’s data structures to write high-performance applications? Let’s dive into some key features and tips to optimize your code!🔍 New & Enhanced Data Structures in .NET 8:1️⃣ Frozen Collections (FrozenDictionary, FrozenSet): -Perfect for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., caches, configs). -These are immutable and optimized for ultra-fast lookups after initialization.2️⃣ PriorityQueue Enhancements: -Already a game-changer for algorithms like Dijkstra’s, but now even morr efficient with improved internal handling.3️⃣ System.Collections.Immutable: -Thread-safe, memory-efficient collections for concurrent workflows.⚡ Performance Tips for Data Structures✅ Choose the Right Tool for the Job: -Lists (List<T>) for dynamic resizing. -Arrays for fixed-size, high-speed access. -Span<T>/Memory<T> for stack-based or non-allocating data slicing.✅ Minimize Boxing/Unboxing: -Use generics (e.g., List<int> instead of ArrayList) to avoid performance-killing boxing.✅ Prefer Structs Over Classes for Small Data: -Reduce GC pressure by using struct for lightweight types (if immutable).✅ Leverage Stack Allocation: -Use stackalloc with Span<T> for short-lived buffers (no heap allocation!).✅ Avoid LINQ Overuse in Hot Paths: -LINQ is convenient but can be slow. Use loops or direct indexing for critical sections.✅ Pool Resources with ArrayPool or MemoryPool: -Reuse large arrays/buffers to reduce GC overhead.🚨 Pro Tip.NET 8’s source generators (like the new collection generator) can auto-generate high-performance code for custom collections.

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 02:- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core?🚫 4. Use a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) to Invalidate TokenAnother approach is to add a revocation flag to the token payload. Then, on logout, update a value in in-memory storage (like Redis) that marks the token as invalid.🔹 Add a tokenId Claim to JWT🔹 Store tokenId in Memory and Invalidate on Logout🔹 Check tokenId on Each Request📌 This approach ensures that logged-out users cannot use their old tokens!🔄 5. Rotate Tokens & Revoke Refresh TokenIf using refresh tokens, revoke them on logout so users cannot obtain new access tokens.🔹 Invalidate Refresh Token on Logout📌 Now, users cannot refresh their session after logging out.Which Method Should You Use?Short-Lived Access Tokens are the simplest and most effective for most applications. Tokens expire automatically, reducing security risks without additional storage.Deleting Tokens from Cookies works best for web apps that store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. Once the cookie is deleted, the token becomes inaccessible.Blacklisting Tokens in Memory is ideal when you need immediate token revocation. It requires in-memory storage (like Redis or MemoryCache) but ensures tokens are blocked right after logout.Using a Custom Claim (Token Versioning) is useful for stateless APIs where you want to track token validity using an external flag. However, it requires additional checks in every request.Rotating and Revoking Refresh Tokens is best when using refresh tokens. By revoking them, users cannot generate new access tokens after logout.For most cases, using short-lived access tokens combined with clearing cookies on logout is sufficient. If you need immediate token revocation, blacklisting or custom claims are better choices. 🚀💡 Which approach do you prefer? Let’s discuss! 👇

Suraj KhodadeSuraj Khodade,,"Part 01 :- 🚀 How to Invalidate or Expire a JWT Token on Logout in .NET Core? Since JWTs are stateless, they cannot be modified or deleted once issued. However, you can effectively invalidate or expire tokens on logout using the following strategies:1️⃣ Short-Lived Access TokensEffect: Token expires automatically after a short time.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Most applications.2️⃣ Delete Token from CookiesEffect: Token becomes inaccessible after logout.Storage Needed: No.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Web apps using HttpOnly cookies.3️⃣ Blacklist Tokens in MemoryEffect: Token is manually blocked on logout.Storage Needed: Yes (e.g., Redis or MemoryCache).Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Apps that require immediate token revocation.4️⃣ Use Custom Claim (Token Versioning)Effect: Token becomes invalid when a stored token ID is revoked.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: Yes.Best For: Stateless APIs needing token validation.5️⃣ Rotate and Revoke Refresh TokensEffect: Prevents users from getting a new access token after logout.Storage Needed: Yes.Immediate Expiry: No.Best For: Secure API authentication using refresh tokens.⏳ 1. Use Short-Lived Access Tokens (Best Practice)This is the simplest and most effective approach:Issue short-lived access tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes).On logout, delete the refresh token, preventing users from getting a new access token.🔹 Set Token Expiry (Short-Lived Token)📌 Now, after logout, the token will expire soon.🍪 2. Store Token in HttpOnly Cookies & Delete on LogoutIf you store the JWT in HttpOnly cookies, you can delete the cookie on logout, making the token inaccessible.🔹 Store Token in Cookie🔹 Delete Cookie on Logout📌 Now, the user cannot send requests with the old token.🔒 3. Blacklist Tokens in Memory (Immediate Expiry)To immediately revoke a JWT, store it in an in-memory blacklist (e.g., Redis, MemoryCache) and reject it on future requests.🔹 Store Revoked Tokens in Memory🔹 Block Blacklisted Tokens in Middleware📌 Now, blacklisted tokens will be rejected immediately!To Be Continued...

A strong resume does 80% of the work!💡 Interviews = Talking Game – Being likable, presentable, and articulate makes a big difference. Strong technical skills alone aren’t enough if communication is weak.💡 Interview Questions Repeat – For similar roles, question patterns become clear. Once prepared, confidence naturally grows.💡 Certifications Help – Surprisingly, this person didn’t even have a GitHub! But an active and well-optimized LinkedIn profile made all the difference.💡 Job Search is a Full-Time Job – The person stayed online on LinkedIn for 14-16 hours daily, relying only on LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.💡 Burnout is Real – Such an intense job search can be mentally exhausting, so self-care is important too.Final Thoughts:For those planning a job switch or salary jump, these insights are gold.
