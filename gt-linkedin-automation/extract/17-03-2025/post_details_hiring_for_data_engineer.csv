SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard.

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks.

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks.

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks.

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?

SAMUEL ADETOYESAMUEL ADETOYE,,"ARE DASHBOARDS DEAD? The Rise of Conversational Database InterfacesI've been working on something that might make traditional dashboards obsolete. Wait, let me explain before you crucify me.For years, we've relied on dashboards to make sense of our data. Build it once, use it forever—or so we thought. But what happens when you need information that falls between the cracks of your carefully designed charts and filters?I built a simple demo natural language database query application Using Java, Spring AI and llama 3.2 running on my local machine that lets users simply ask questions about their data in plain English: ""How many customers signed up last month in Europe?"" ""Show me all overdue invoices over $10,000."" ""What's our customer retention rate compared to last year?""Advantages over traditional dashboards:Zero learning curve—if you can ask a question, you can get dataNo more waiting for IT to build custom reportsDiscover unexpected insights by asking questions dashboard designers never anticipatedAccessible to non-technical team members who would never touch SQLLimitations:Complex analyses still benefit from visual dashboardsRelies on quality AI to understand intent correctlyAnswers are only as good as your database structureSome questions require visual context that text alone can't provide and others.The sweet spot: This approach shines for operational questions and quick decision support. It democratizes data access while freeing up analysts from endless report requests.Imagine taking this a step further - by adding voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, you'd be able to control your entire data ecosystem without even touching a keyboard. 'Hey DataBot, how are our Q1 sales trending?' while you're preparing your morning coffee. The line between science fiction and enterprise software gets thinner every day.The future isn't about choosing between dashboards OR conversational interfaces—it's about leveraging both for their strengths.Dashboards for planned, recurring analysis; conversation for exploration and the unexpected.What do you think?Would you replace your dashboards with a conversational interface? Or is this just another tool in the data toolkit?If you want to have access to the code, let me know in the comment section.In my next post , I will talk on building LLMS apps in Java with Jakata and Langchain4J. Stay tune.PS: Oops—looks like my AI assistant just revealed my database schema in public! 😅 This is why we add guardrails, folks. Even our digital assistants can accidentally overshare sometimes.hashtag#Graceman hashtag#JavaBoy hashtag#DataInnovation hashtag#ConversationalAI hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#NaturalLanguageProcessing

John KAYODE-ABUSIJohn KAYODE-ABUSI,,"🚀 What Do Hiring Managers Look for in Data Engineers? Process Knowledge or Specific Technology/Platform Skills?🔍 Data Engineering Landscape OverviewAs data engineering continues to evolve, hiring managers face a critical decision: prioritize process knowledge or technology expertise? Today’s data engineers are expected to understand data pipelines, ETL workflows, and real-time analytics, while also mastering various tools and platforms. But what does the hiring experience reveal about these expectations? Let’s break it down.🏢 ERPs & Enterprise Data PlatformsHow does this skillset translate beyond enterprise landscapes?Enterprise systems like Oracle, SAP, and Informatica handle massive datasets, demanding expertise in platform-specific tools:Oracle: GoldenGate and ODI for data integration.SAP: DataSphere for integration, HANA for real-time analytics.Informatica: Comprehensive data integration and governance solutions.In these environments, hiring managers prioritize platform-specific skills and a deep understanding of enterprise-level data architecture.🛠️ Open Source ToolsOpen-source tools offer flexibility and scalability for data integration, orchestration, and data lakes/warehouses. While Apache Hudi, Apache Doris, and Delta Lake lead the open-source data warehouse/lake space, tools like Talend Open Studio, Pentaho, Apache NiFi, and Airflow handle data integration and transformation.In this domain, hiring managers seek professionals who can craft customized data solutions and demonstrate proficiency with these tools. But what gives candidates the edge in open-source environments?☁️ Cloud PlatformsCloud platforms have become the backbone of modern data engineering, delivering scalable solutions for data management:AWS: Glue, Redshift, S3 for data management.Azure: Data Factory, Synapse Analytics for cloud pipelines.Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow for AI/ML.In cloud-driven environments, hiring managers value cloud-native expertise, particularly with tools like AWS Glue, Azure Synapse, and BigQuery. Does possessing cloud data skills make candidates more competitive for data engineering roles?🔄 What Should Hiring Managers Look For?So, what matters more: process knowledge or platform expertise? The answer often depends on the environment:Process Knowledge: A solid grasp of data workflows, ETL/ELT, and data transformation is universally valuable across platforms like Oracle, SAP, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How does this tilt the scale for practitioners?Platform Expertise: Mastery of specific tools and technologies can be a game-changer in environments that rely heavily on particular platforms.Ultimately, hiring managers need to assess their organizational needs and strike a balance between these skill sets.What do you think holds greater weight in today’s data engineering landscape — deep process knowledge or specialized platform expertise? Let’s continue the conversation! 🚀

Anna Riddell (Ridniak)Anna Riddell (Ridniak),,"The article published by MacroBusiness argues that the widely reported “labour shortages” in Australia are misleading, attributing the perceived scarcity to employers’ inability or unwillingness to hire from the existing applicant pool. However, a crucial factor understated in the article is the prevalent bias within HR departments, particularly towards skilled international candidates.HR professionals often filter applications based on subjective or implicit criteria such as accents, type of visa, or national origin.Empirical research indicates that applicants with foreign accents or non-permanent residency statuses face substantial barriers, irrespective of their experience or qualifications.A significant experiment conducted by Monash University involved sending 12,000 fictitious job applications, changing only the candidates’ names. The results showed that resumes with Anglo-Saxon names received significantly more callbacks compared to identical resumes with Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, or even Greek-sounding names. For leadership positions, the discrepancy was even more pronounced, with ethnic-sounding names receiving 57% fewer callbacks. Crucially, all resumes indicated applicants as born and educated in Australia, demonstrating that the only variable was the implied ethnic origin based on names. This clearly reveals a systemic bias within HR departments, favouring candidates perceived as culturally familiar.This bias translates into real-world disadvantages for qualified migrants. A common scenario involves highly skilled professionals, such as engineers, migrating to Australia only to find themselves excluded from their fields due to discriminatory hiring practices.Research from RMIT highlights that Australia now has an oversupply of overqualified delivery drivers and taxi drivers due to skilled migrants being unable to penetrate the professional job market. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), a majority of skilled migrants do not work within their area of expertise. Data indicates that 44% of permanent migrants are employed in roles significantly below their qualification level, translating into over 620,000 skilled individuals whose capabilities are underutilized.Ironically, many of these individuals were selected precisely because of their professional skills under Australia’s skilled migration programs, suggesting that the current visa policy and recruitment methods are flawed and not delivering the intended economic benefits. Rather than addressing skill shortages, current recruitment practices, including HR biases, exacerbate inefficiencies and negatively impact Australia’s productivity by failing to harness available talent effectively.

Jonathan DaskalakisJonathan Daskalakis,,"What's the market like? Possibly the most common question when speaking to candidates and hiring managers since the beginning of time. Even as recruiters who speak with people in the market every day, in can be a hard question to answer as activity in the market can differ drastically between industries, AI vs Data Engineering and contract vs perm opportunities among a heap of other areas. What I can say is that to start the year, hiring seems to be returning to 2021/22 levels even if it's not 100% there yet. The big 4 banks (CBA and Westpac in particular) are in the midst of a hiring frenzy and this typically drives hiring across the rest of the market - startup/scaleups and mid-sized businesses are starting to follow suite as their confidence to hire typically increases when the bigger players put their foot on the gas. Consultancies are winning more projects. Contracting is coming back in style. Teams are hiring for more than one engineer at the same time. All of these are great early positive signs for the tech market and reason to be cautiously optimistic after a rough last few years. What else are you seeing at the moment?
