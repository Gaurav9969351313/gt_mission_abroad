Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

DEV RAJDEV RAJ,,TBDC pitches a new narrative for Canadian startups
Net-EmpregosNet-Empregos,,Content Moderation with Ukrainian
Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho? Los leo. 👇hashtag#TI hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#SalariosDignos hashtag#RespetoAlTalento hashtag#NoMásMultitaskMalPagados hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Look for individuals who can articulate their thoughts clearly and show genuine enthusiasm for the role.Pro tip: During interviews, ask scenario-based questions that reveal a candidate's problem-solving approach and ability to collaborate virtually. This can give you valuable insights into their attitude and cultural fit.What's your experience with hiring for attitude vs. technical skills in remote teams? Share your thoughts in the comments!hashtag#RemoteWorkSuccess hashtag#OutsourcedStaff

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle.

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries.

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Molly ZhangMolly Zhang,,"For the past few months, I’ve been working a part-time, non-technical job to pay the bills while continuing my job search. But if I’m being honest, I miss coding. I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product. If you’re a startup founder looking for technical support or a company hiring contract developers, let’s chat! If you know of any opportunities, feel free to reach out or tag someone who might be interested. Excited to get back to building!  🫡

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries.

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Oladapo OmonayajoOladapo Omonayajo,,"Asking someone to code without an IDE during an interview is a waste of everyone's time in my opinion.Has there ever been a time in your organisation's history when you needed a QA engineer (or any other engineer) to write code in Notepad to fix an issue or to rollout a feature?Inasmuch as we're trying to ascertain people's coding competence, we need to also maintain an air of realism with these interviews. Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term. I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product.

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

I’m open to **short-term projects (e.g., 3 months, part-time, remote)** where I can help build, automate, or scale a product. If you’re a startup founder looking for technical support or a company hiring contract developers, let’s chat! If you know of any opportunities, feel free to reach out or tag someone who might be interested. Excited to get back to building!  🫡

Oladapo OmonayajoOladapo Omonayajo,,"Asking someone to code without an IDE during an interview is a waste of everyone's time in my opinion.Has there ever been a time in your organisation's history when you needed a QA engineer (or any other engineer) to write code in Notepad to fix an issue or to rollout a feature?Inasmuch as we're trying to ascertain people's coding competence, we need to also maintain an air of realism with these interviews. Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Zohaeb RiazZohaeb Riaz,zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag,"This is something I’ve been talking according to my experience and also hearing on forums, panels, and at events from small business and startup founders. Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Hiring a full-time CTO can feel like a huge leap. Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term.

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Waqar MahmoodWaqar Mahmood,,"🚨 The Hidden Cost of Poor QA: More Than Just Bugs! 💰Most teams think of Quality Assurance (QA) as a checkbox—until things go wrong. But the real impact of poor QA isn’t just in bug counts; it’s in missed revenue, frustrated teams, and lost customer trust.🔥 The True Cost of Poor QA 🔥-------------------------------⚡ Team Burnout – Developers & testers spend more time fixing than innovating. Morale drops, and top talent leaves.⏳ Leadership Struggles – Decision-makers face delayed releases, reputation damage, and firefighting crises instead of strategic growth.💸 Revenue Loss – A single critical bug can result in customer churn, refunds, legal risks, and a tarnished brand—all of which are way more expensive than investing in QA early!🔧 How to Fix It 🔧------------------1️⃣ Make QA a Business Priority – Quality isn’t just a tech concern; it’s a business strategy. Leadership should invest in QA talent, tools, and processes early.2️⃣ Strengthen Collaboration Between Dev & QA – Break silos! Encourage cross-team communication so developers and testers work together from day one.3️⃣ Empower a Quality Culture – Quality is everyone’s job! Train devs, testers, and product teams to think about quality from the start.4️⃣ Invest in the Right Talent – Don’t cut corners on hiring skilled QA professionals. They save you millions in hidden costs down the road!💡 Founders, QA leaders, and engineering teams—how do you ensure quality is built into your development process?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

I’ve started to feel a little rusty, and I don’t want to lose the technical skills I’ve worked so hard to build. So, I’m looking for ways to stay sharp. I’m a software developer with experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and QA, and I’d love to contribute to an early-stage startup or take on a contract role that could turn into something long-term.

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Waqar MahmoodWaqar Mahmood,,"🚨 The Hidden Cost of Poor QA: More Than Just Bugs! 💰Most teams think of Quality Assurance (QA) as a checkbox—until things go wrong. But the real impact of poor QA isn’t just in bug counts; it’s in missed revenue, frustrated teams, and lost customer trust.🔥 The True Cost of Poor QA 🔥-------------------------------⚡ Team Burnout – Developers & testers spend more time fixing than innovating. Morale drops, and top talent leaves.⏳ Leadership Struggles – Decision-makers face delayed releases, reputation damage, and firefighting crises instead of strategic growth.💸 Revenue Loss – A single critical bug can result in customer churn, refunds, legal risks, and a tarnished brand—all of which are way more expensive than investing in QA early!🔧 How to Fix It 🔧------------------1️⃣ Make QA a Business Priority – Quality isn’t just a tech concern; it’s a business strategy. Leadership should invest in QA talent, tools, and processes early.2️⃣ Strengthen Collaboration Between Dev & QA – Break silos! Encourage cross-team communication so developers and testers work together from day one.3️⃣ Empower a Quality Culture – Quality is everyone’s job! Train devs, testers, and product teams to think about quality from the start.4️⃣ Invest in the Right Talent – Don’t cut corners on hiring skilled QA professionals. They save you millions in hidden costs down the road!💡 Founders, QA leaders, and engineering teams—how do you ensure quality is built into your development process?

Stephen LimStephen Lim,,"My own analysis on why there was a frequent change in QA leadership within a company. It was quite discouraging that eventually, all blames went to the QA leader. The so-called quality culture is not complicated and can be quickly achieved by having the whole company's leadership starting to respect standards, defined procedures and work around them to improve them. Individualism should be kept at bay within an ISO 9001 certified company.You can have charismatic leadership style in doing sales talk, all-hands meeting etc. But your operations should be steered and guided by SOPs. If you don't like them, then improved them. Not using 'verbal direction"" to supercede SOP creates a positive quality culture.

Akash AjmalAkash Ajmal,,"Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two related but distinct concepts in the field of quality management. Understanding the differences between QA and QC can help you apply these principles to your daily operations, whether in a project or personal life.Quality Assurance (QA)QA focuses on preventing defects and ensuring that processes are in place to maintain quality throughout the entire product or service lifecycle. QA involves:1. Process development: Establishing procedures and guidelines to ensure quality.2. Training and awareness: Educating teams on quality processes and standards.3. Audits and reviews: Regularly evaluating processes to ensure compliance with quality standards.4. Continuous improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes.Quality Control (QC)QC focuses on detecting and correcting defects after they have occurred. QC involves:1. Inspection and testing: Evaluating products or services to identify defects or deviations from quality standards.2. Defect correction: Correcting defects or reworking products to meet quality standards.3. Quality metrics: Collecting and analyzing data to measure quality performance.Applying QA and QC to Daily Operations1. Project Management: Implement QA processes during project planning to prevent defects and ensure quality. Use QC to inspect and test deliverables to detect and correct defects.2. Personal Life: Apply QA principles to your daily routine by establishing processes and habits that promote quality, such as creating a schedule or to-do list. Use QC to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed.3. Home Maintenance: Implement QA processes to prevent maintenance issues, such as regular cleaning and inspection schedules. Use QC to detect and correct maintenance issues, such as leaky faucets or faulty electrical outlets.Real-Life Examples1. Cooking: QA involves following a recipe and using quality ingredients to prevent defects (e.g., undercooked or overcooked food). QC involves tasting and adjusting the seasoning to ensure the dish meets quality standards.2. Writing: QA involves planning and outlining your writing to ensure clarity and coherence. QC involves editing and proofreading to detect and correct errors.3. Travel Planning: QA involves researching and booking reliable transportation and accommodations to prevent defects (e.g., flight delays or hotel issues). QC involves verifying travel arrangements and making adjustments as needed.Basically by understanding the differences between QA and QC, you can apply these principles to your daily operations to promote quality, prevent defects, and ensure continuous improvement.hashtag#humanresources hashtag#hr, hashtag#jobinterviews hashtag#hiringandpromotion hashtag#jobalert hashtag#nowhiring, hashtag#job hashtag#gethired hashtag#jobopening hashtag#jobfair hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobopening, hashtag#hiring, hashtag#joinourteam, hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobhirin, hashtag#remotework hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearching hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#workingathome hashtag#hire

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"Un 💼 Full Stack: El “Médico General” del Desarrollo de SoftwareSi hay un puesto que los reclutadores aman vender como la solución a todos los problemas, es el Full Stack Developer. Suena impresionante, ¿verdad? Un todoterreno capaz de hacer backend, frontend, DevOps y lo que se les ocurra. El problema no es el puesto, sino el abuso que se ha generado en torno a él.🔍 ¿Qué buscan?✅ Un backend senior con experiencia en microservicios, SQL, NoSQL, arquitectura limpia y escalabilidad.✅ Un frontend que domine React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript y hasta frameworks que ni existen.✅ Un DevOps que implemente CI/CD, maneje Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, AWS y Google Cloud como si fuera arquitecto de nube.✅ Un QA Automation que escriba pruebas unitarias, de integración, funcionales y hasta prediga los bugs antes de que ocurran.💰 ¿Y qué ofrecen?🚨 Sueldos de hace 10 años.🚨 “Prestaciones de ley” como si fueran un beneficio extra.🚨 Jornadas laborales absurdas disfrazadas de “somos una gran familia”.🚨 Contratos temporales, outsourcing y cero estabilidad.📌 Lo que realmente quieren es un ejército en un solo candidato.🔴 Full Stack se ha convertido en sinónimo de “hazlo todo por el mismo sueldo”.🔴 Las empresas lo usan para no contratar a tres personas y pagarle a una sola lo mínimo posible.🔴 Los reclutadores lo venden como un puesto de alto nivel, pero el salario y condiciones son de becario.💊 Por eso lo comparo con un médico general:🩺 Lo quieren para todo: backend, frontend, infraestructura, seguridad y hasta liderazgo.💊 Le pagan poco y esperan que haga milagros.⏳ Lo exprimen hasta que encuentra algo mejor y se va.🚨 Empresas y reclutadores: Dejen de buscar unicornios a precio de becario. Si quieren talento, paguen lo que vale.🚨 Desarrolladores: No regalen su conocimiento ni se conformen con menos de lo que merecen.💬 Ahora cuéntenme, ¿cuál ha sido la peor oferta de Full Stack que les han hecho?

Maybe your company doesn’t feel established enough, the budget isn’t there, or the role doesn’t justify a full-time hire just yet.What happens instead?- Someone on your team ends up wearing all the hats, even if it’s outside their expertise.- You hire an agency, but struggle to manage the relationship internally.- Tech decisions get made hastily, and suddenly you’re tangled in a mess of disconnected tools and inefficient processes.You know you need help, but you’re not quite sure what the role should be or which skills are actually required.Here’s how I’ve been helping as a Fractional CTO.I step in to hear you out, and:- Audit your business’s tech needs.- Identify which roles are truly necessary at your specific stage- Advise on what to custom-build vs when to procure off-the-shelf solutions- Connect you with the right talent, e.g. fractional, freelance, vendors, part-time, offshore.-Advise on best ERP solutionOver the years, I’ve worked in small, medium, and the largest companies and consultancies, and for clients across a huge range of industries. I've built a trusted network of skilled professionals, including frontend and backend developers, DevOps engineers, ERP Specialist, product managers, UX/UI designers, QA analysts, AI/ML specialists, and immersive tech gurus. I can also suggest offshore and nearshore options in every part of the globe and help you vet and manage those relationships. If this sounds like a situation you’re facing, feel free to reach out. I work on a project basis - no commitment, no long-term contracts, and no project is too small. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh set of eyes to tackle one piece of the puzzle. I offer a free discovery call, so let’s chat and see if there’s a part of your tech challenge I can help you solve.Email: zohaeb.riaz@i2igulf.comhashtag#technolgy hashtag#itstratgey hashtag#d365 hashtag#yardi hashtag#realestate hashtag#sap hashtag#cto hashtag#cio #recruiters#itmanagers

Jeyakirushna TJeyakirushna T,,"Why Do Companies Use ATS & How Does It Work?Ever applied for a job and never heard back? It’s not always because a recruiter ignored your resume—it might have been filtered out by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).So, what is an ATS, and why do companies use it?Companies get hundreds of resumes for a single job. Manually reviewing all of them is impossible, so ATS helps by automating the screening process. It scans resumes, filters out unqualified candidates, and ranks applications based on relevance to the job description.How ATS Works:1️⃣ Scans Your Resume – It reads your document and extracts details like experience, skills, and education.2️⃣ Matches Keywords – The system looks for specific words from the job posting. If your resume lacks them, it might not get shortlisted.3️⃣ Ranks & Filters Candidates – It scores resumes based on relevance and removes those that don’t meet the criteria.How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:✔ Use simple formatting – No fancy designs, tables, or images.✔ Include job-specific keywords – Match your resume to the job description.✔ Stick to clear headings – Use standard sections like Work Experience, Skills, Education.At the end of the day, ATS helps recruiters manage applications more efficiently, but a well-optimized resume ensures you don’t get lost in the system.Ever had an experience with ATS?

Granted, there are GenAI coding assistant plugins for most IDEs these days and you're trying to guard against that. But even then, it takes someone that knows what they're doing to know when the generated code is correct and understand the reason any generated code works the way it does.To me, this reeks of laziness on the part of the hiring organisation and I say, we can definitely do better

Words cannot express how much Jostin meant to me, the team, the game, and the studio.  Thank you for everything, Jostin.

Waqar MahmoodWaqar Mahmood,,"🚨 The Hidden Cost of Poor QA: More Than Just Bugs! 💰Most teams think of Quality Assurance (QA) as a checkbox—until things go wrong. But the real impact of poor QA isn’t just in bug counts; it’s in missed revenue, frustrated teams, and lost customer trust.🔥 The True Cost of Poor QA 🔥-------------------------------⚡ Team Burnout – Developers & testers spend more time fixing than innovating. Morale drops, and top talent leaves.⏳ Leadership Struggles – Decision-makers face delayed releases, reputation damage, and firefighting crises instead of strategic growth.💸 Revenue Loss – A single critical bug can result in customer churn, refunds, legal risks, and a tarnished brand—all of which are way more expensive than investing in QA early!🔧 How to Fix It 🔧------------------1️⃣ Make QA a Business Priority – Quality isn’t just a tech concern; it’s a business strategy. Leadership should invest in QA talent, tools, and processes early.2️⃣ Strengthen Collaboration Between Dev & QA – Break silos! Encourage cross-team communication so developers and testers work together from day one.3️⃣ Empower a Quality Culture – Quality is everyone’s job! Train devs, testers, and product teams to think about quality from the start.4️⃣ Invest in the Right Talent – Don’t cut corners on hiring skilled QA professionals. They save you millions in hidden costs down the road!💡 Founders, QA leaders, and engineering teams—how do you ensure quality is built into your development process? Let’s discuss in the comments! 👇
