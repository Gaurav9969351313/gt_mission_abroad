Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Trending Live NewsTrending Live News,,Fired CDC Scientists Are Reinstated for Now
Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Trending Live NewsTrending Live News,,Fired CDC Scientists Are Reinstated for Now
Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out.

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Jenny NguyenJenny Nguyen,,"🚀 Are you staying ahead of the game when it comes to the programming languages and frameworks driving New Zealand's tech landscape? 🌐In my conversations with candidates recently, I've been asked a lot about the most commonly used programming languages in New Zealand's tech market. Although I'm not a tech hiring manager, I absolutely love my job in IT recruitment because it gives me so many opportunities to continuously grow my knowledge in the tech space, especially through the conversations with our clients, and learning from Holistica Consulting Ltd (appreciate the opportunity from Amanda Van Ryn Lexel Resourcing )If you’re a job seeker or looking to upskill, here are the top programming languages and frameworks you should keep an eye on:👉 Python -Renowned for its simplicity and versatility, Python is extensively used in data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Trending Live NewsTrending Live News,,Fired CDC Scientists Are Reinstated for Now
Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Trending Live NewsTrending Live News,,Fired CDC Scientists Are Reinstated for Now
Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Scott FordScott Ford,,"At the beginning of my layoff, everyone told me be patient. I’ll be the first to admit, that maybe I was getting a bit antsy. However, everyone was right! After spending weeks of retooling my resume, with the help of career coaches and friends, things are looking up! Recruiters are calling, interviews are becoming more frequent, and hopefully some offers are not far behind. I can’t say enough about the encouragement and coaching I have received along the way. I hope the tips I’ve shared with others are helping as well. It’s easy to get bitter after a layoff, but my positive attitude and hardwork have helped me remained focused and ready for whatever comes next!If you’re a fellow job seeker or even a future job seeker, don’t be afraid to reach out. I was a hiring manager in my previous role and I believe I can help others along their own journey. I’m happy to help provide tips that have brought me a little bit of success.

Trending Live NewsTrending Live News,,Fired CDC Scientists Are Reinstated for Now
Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Its readability makes it a preferred choice for both beginners and seasoned developers.👉JavaScript - Essential for web development, JavaScript enables interactive features on websites and is integral to front-end development.👉Java - A robust, object-oriented language widely utilized in enterprise solutions, mobile applications, and large-scale systems.👉C# - Favored for developing Windows applications, games using the Unity engine, and enterprise software, C# combines efficiency with a rich feature set.👉Ruby - Known for its elegant syntax, Ruby is often employed in web applications, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework, facilitating rapid development.In addition to these languages, proficiency in specific frameworks and technologies significantly enhances a developer's value in the New Zealand job market:⚡ React and Angular -These JavaScript frameworks are pivotal for building dynamic and responsive web applications.⚡ Flutter- A framework for mobile app development, Flutter allows developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.⚡ AWS and Azure - Expertise in cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure is highly sought after, reflecting the global shift towards cloud solutions.⚡ DevOps Practices - Understanding DevOps methodologies is crucial for streamlining development and operations, enhancing deployment frequency, and achieving faster time to market.📈 Why is this important? These skills are in demand across industries like software development, fintech, gaming, AI, and machine learning. Mastering these technologies will help you remain competitive and open up exciting opportunities in New Zealand’s growing tech sector.💡 Are there any other languages or frameworks you think should be on this list? Drop a comment 👇 hashtag#Techrecruitment hashtag#Programming hashtag#NewZealandJobs hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#Coding hashtag#Developers hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CodingSkills hashtag#NZTechTalent hashtag#ProgrammingLanguages hashtag#TechProfessionals hashtag#DeveloperCareer hashtag#ITjobs hashtag#ITrecruitment

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Its readability makes it a preferred choice for both beginners and seasoned developers.👉JavaScript - Essential for web development, JavaScript enables interactive features on websites and is integral to front-end development.👉Java - A robust, object-oriented language widely utilized in enterprise solutions, mobile applications, and large-scale systems.👉C# - Favored for developing Windows applications, games using the Unity engine, and enterprise software, C# combines efficiency with a rich feature set.👉Ruby - Known for its elegant syntax, Ruby is often employed in web applications, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework, facilitating rapid development.In addition to these languages, proficiency in specific frameworks and technologies significantly enhances a developer's value in the New Zealand job market:⚡ React and Angular -These JavaScript frameworks are pivotal for building dynamic and responsive web applications.⚡ Flutter- A framework for mobile app development, Flutter allows developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.⚡ AWS and Azure - Expertise in cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure is highly sought after, reflecting the global shift towards cloud solutions.⚡ DevOps Practices - Understanding DevOps methodologies is crucial for streamlining development and operations, enhancing deployment frequency, and achieving faster time to market.📈 Why is this important? These skills are in demand across industries like software development, fintech, gaming, AI, and machine learning. Mastering these technologies will help you remain competitive and open up exciting opportunities in New Zealand’s growing tech sector.💡 Are there any other languages or frameworks you think should be on this list? Drop a comment 👇 hashtag#Techrecruitment hashtag#Programming hashtag#NewZealandJobs hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#Coding hashtag#Developers hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CodingSkills hashtag#NZTechTalent hashtag#ProgrammingLanguages hashtag#TechProfessionals hashtag#DeveloperCareer hashtag#ITjobs hashtag#ITrecruitment

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C

Tyler YeagerTyler Yeager,,"Hello, LinkedIn. After being laid off in July 2023, I’ve spent the past year reflecting on my career and where I can make the most impact. I did attempt to return to the Bureau of Land Management as a Park Ranger, but the federal hiring freeze and subsequent layoffs made that path difficult. Now, I’m eager to re-enter the workforce and explore new opportunities where I can blend my software development skills with my passion for parks and recreation, or even pivot into other tech-related roles.I have a diverse background that includes software development as well as hands-on experience in federal parks and recreation. In my time as a ranger, I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and project management skills. One of my key projects involved leading the implementation of a travel management plan designed to mitigate erosion and sedimentation that was impacting nearby farmland. This initiative required cross-functional collaboration, effective project oversight, and strategic problem-solving to achieve long-term environmental sustainability.While some of my tech skills may be a bit rusty, I’m eager to refresh them and grow within a team that can offer structure and mentorship. I’m confident that with the right support, I can quickly get up to speed and contribute effectively. I’m also open to exploring roles outside of software development and within the broader tech-related space, particularly those where I can utilize both my technical expertise and my experience in parks and recreation.Here’s what I bring:-Software development experience with Java, JavaScript, and full-stack technologies. While I may need a refresher, I’m ready to dive back in and learn quickly with the right guidance.-Project management and leadership experience, including overseeing initiatives that addressed environmental challenges and required effective collaboration and strategic oversight.-Problem-solving, adaptability, task prioritization, and communication—skills honed in the field that translate well to any role, especially in fast-paced or dynamic environments.-A commitment to growth and learning, with a strong desire for mentorship and structured learning to help me bridge any gaps in my skills.If you know of any opportunities or resources where I can receive the support needed to get back on track, I’d be incredibly grateful for your help. Whether in software development, parks and recreation, other tech-related roles, or some combination. I’m excited to find a position where I can contribute, learn, and grow.Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to what’s ahead!hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#JobSeeking hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#TechIndustry hashtag#ParksAndRecreation hashtag#FederalParkRanger hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#CareerReboot hashtag#LearningJourney

Shreyas ShahaneShreyas Shahane,,"After I completed my Engg ( B.E. Computer Science ) in 2008 it was recession time and the IT companies were laying off people instead of hiring them. So I did Core Java and Advanced Java classes. Just to be good at Java I did a Web based Project for 6 months. The technologies used were JSP, Sevlets, JDBC and MySQL.As I was good at Java I got my first Job as a Android developer in Feb 2009. The language was the same i.e. Java but the library was different so I had to learn the library and slowly I got good at it. Apart from this there was one big change, I had done a web based Project but this was a Mobile environment. I was working on Android Mobile Applications during that time. So I had to adjust to this environment.After a year of working as a Android developer I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. Now the interesting part about this company was that it was founded by a group of IITians. Good things happen to those who work hard and keep learning. There they moved me from Android to iOS. So I had to learn the Objective-C language and memory management. In Java memory management was handled by the System and in Objective-C memory management has to be handled by the developer. So I had to learn that. Here I worked on some small apps and some mid sized apps.After a year or so in 2010 I got a better opportunity and I moved to another company. In this company I was the first person to be hired in the Mobile team. The interesting part about this company was that it was a Australia based company. After a year or so Objective-C moved from memory management being handled by the developer to ARC i.e. Automatic Reference Counting. So now the developer didn't have to handle the memory allocation and deallocation as it was done by the system. Here I developed their iOS app from scratch and launched the first 2 versions of their app. I worked in this company for almost 4 years and they paid me well too. After that they completely shut their IT development team in India and I lost my job due to that.In 2016 I worked in another company. Here I did feature enhancements and bug fixing. After some time I moved to another company and developed an educational app from scratch.In 2022 I learnt the Swift language as Apple iOS had moved from Objective-C to Swift as the primary language. I know I was a bit late at learning Swift but I couldn't help it ( Just before this it was Covid time for almost 3 years ). I worked on a huge app during this time.Apple has also come up with a brand new UI library known as Swift UI.In the Mobile Application Development space many new technologies have sprung up like Flutter and React Native which are  being used by many Tech Companies.So the only thing that I have understood in all these years is that one must KEEP WORKING HARD and KEEP LEARNING.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#MobileApplicationDevelopment hashtag#Java hashtag#Android hashtag#Apple hashtag#iOS hashtag#Swift hashtag#Objective-C
