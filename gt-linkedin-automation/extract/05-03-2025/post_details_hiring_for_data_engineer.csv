Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable.

Akshay AgrawalAkshay Agrawal,,"We're hiring! Onos Health is looking for a few fantastic engineers and data scientists for our team. Roles are posted below. Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Akshay AgrawalAkshay Agrawal,,"We're hiring! Onos Health is looking for a few fantastic engineers and data scientists for our team. Roles are posted below. Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Akshay AgrawalAkshay Agrawal,,"We're hiring! Onos Health is looking for a few fantastic engineers and data scientists for our team. Roles are posted below. Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Akshay AgrawalAkshay Agrawal,,"We're hiring! Onos Health is looking for a few fantastic engineers and data scientists for our team. Roles are posted below. Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Natalie FengNatalie Feng,,"Growing up, the world of engineers was an elusive one to me. Whenever my young students asked what engineering is about, I vaguely refer them to Tony Stark (technology‚Ä¶.. and mostly men dominated).The exclusive visit to AMD Singapore gave me another perspective into the engineering world! It was a timely visit, held in conjunction with hashtag#InternationalWomenDay, to highlight female diversity in the field. It was heartening to see our curious female hashtag#SITizens from Computing Science, Applied AI, and Electronics & Data Engineering engaged in conversations with the hiring manager, engineers and interns.

Glen HewardGlen Heward,,"Australia‚Äôs Skills Shortage: It‚Äôs Not Going Away Anytime SoonIf you thought the skills shortage would ease post-pandemic, think again. 36% of all assessed occupations in Australia are in shortage‚Äîand it‚Äôs not just in one sector.Healthcare ‚Äì Chronic shortages in nursing, aged care, and allied health are putting pressure on an already stretched system.IT & Cybersecurity ‚Äì The demand for software engineers, data specialists, and cybersecurity professionals has outpaced supply.Trades & Construction ‚Äì Every major construction trade is in shortage, from electricians to carpenters, slowing down critical projects.Manufacturing & Logistics ‚Äì Supply chain disruptions highlighted the need for skilled workers, but they‚Äôre hard to find.So, what‚Äôs driving this? A combination of factors:Pandemic disruptions ‚Äì Border closures cut off skilled migration just as demand surged.Aging workforce ‚Äì Many industries are seeing older workers retire faster than new talent is being trained.Mismatch between education and industry needs ‚Äì More jobs require digital skills, but training isn‚Äôt keeping up.Employers are feeling the pinch. Wages are rising, competition for talent is fierce, and organisations are being forced to rethink hiring strategies. Some are upskilling existing staff, while others are looking overseas for talent.The skills gap isn‚Äôt a short-term challenge‚Äîit‚Äôs a long-term shift. The question isn‚Äôt just who can fill these roles, but how we adapt as an industry to attract, train, and retain the right talent.What are you seeing in your sector?

Sam BoboevSam Boboev,,"Fintech News üö®: Accounting hasn‚Äôt fully embraced AI yet ‚Äî Quanta just raised $4.7M to change thatAI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, from humanoid robots to autonomous warships. But there‚Äôs a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies like Numeric and Kick last year, to name a few. The latest startup to ride this wave is Quanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil. Quanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings‚Äô time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,‚Äù Hastings told TechCrunch. So Quanta‚Äôs platform hoovers up data from a company‚Äôs existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.That‚Äôs a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench, which tried ‚Äî and failed ‚Äî to automate some of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers. So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.The fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that‚Äôs dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024, according to PitchBook data. Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn‚Äôt picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more. With this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she‚Äôs excited for larger organizations to ‚Äúexpect more‚Äù from their accounting tools ‚Äúbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.‚ÄùSource Techcrunchhashtag#fintech hashtag#ai hashtag#accounting Michele Jason Ferda Nik Rex Grant Rutger

Please reach out if you have any questions.Onos is on a mission to ensure every healthcare dollar is spent on high-quality care. There are too many reasons why Healthcare is unaffordable in the U.S, but one of the largest is waste. In some specialties, up to 40% of healthcare spend is lost on inefficiencies, administrative costs, and ineffective care practices. These dollars should be spent on better care (especially for those in need) and making healthcare more affordable. We‚Äôre building a system that unites providers and payers with one goal: delivering the highest quality care while eliminating waste.Join us and help solve this.

Sam BoboevSam Boboev,,"Fintech News üö®: Accounting hasn‚Äôt fully embraced AI yet ‚Äî Quanta just raised $4.7M to change thatAI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, from humanoid robots to autonomous warships. But there‚Äôs a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies like Numeric and Kick last year, to name a few. The latest startup to ride this wave is Quanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil. Quanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings‚Äô time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,‚Äù Hastings told TechCrunch. So Quanta‚Äôs platform hoovers up data from a company‚Äôs existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.That‚Äôs a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench, which tried ‚Äî and failed ‚Äî to automate some of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers. So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.The fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that‚Äôs dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024, according to PitchBook data. Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn‚Äôt picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more. With this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she‚Äôs excited for larger organizations to ‚Äúexpect more‚Äù from their accounting tools ‚Äúbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.‚ÄùSource Techcrunchhashtag#fintech hashtag#ai hashtag#accounting Michele Jason Ferda Nik Rex Grant Rutger

Sam BoboevSam Boboev,,"Fintech News üö®: Accounting hasn‚Äôt fully embraced AI yet ‚Äî Quanta just raised $4.7M to change thatAI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, from humanoid robots to autonomous warships. But there‚Äôs a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies like Numeric and Kick last year, to name a few. The latest startup to ride this wave is Quanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil. Quanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings‚Äô time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,‚Äù Hastings told TechCrunch. So Quanta‚Äôs platform hoovers up data from a company‚Äôs existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.That‚Äôs a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench, which tried ‚Äî and failed ‚Äî to automate some of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers. So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.The fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that‚Äôs dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024, according to PitchBook data. Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn‚Äôt picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more. With this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she‚Äôs excited for larger organizations to ‚Äúexpect more‚Äù from their accounting tools ‚Äúbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.‚ÄùSource Techcrunchhashtag#fintech hashtag#ai hashtag#accounting Michele Jason Ferda Nik Rex Grant Rutger
