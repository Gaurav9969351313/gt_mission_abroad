But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

Gabriella MoreiraGabriella Moreira,,"🔎🐞 My mindset as a QAProfessional pessimism?From my point of view, it’s a positive thing.A QA tester's professional pessimism isn’t about being demotivated or pessimistic in the classical sense. It’s about having an unwavering focus on anticipating problems before they visibly manifest! Before they become obstacles to the product’s success. This “walking on the wrong side” allows us to identify defects that other teams, often more optimistic, may overlook, especially in a scenario where everyone tends to focus on the positive aspects and the functionalities that are working well. The QA tester adopts a different approach: they put themselves on the “wrong side” of the situation, intentionally looking for gaps that could compromise the user experience or the product’s performance. Pessimism and success.

Gabriella MoreiraGabriella Moreira,,"🔎🐞 My mindset as a QAProfessional pessimism?From my point of view, it’s a positive thing.A QA tester's professional pessimism isn’t about being demotivated or pessimistic in the classical sense. It’s about having an unwavering focus on anticipating problems before they visibly manifest! Before they become obstacles to the product’s success. This “walking on the wrong side” allows us to identify defects that other teams, often more optimistic, may overlook, especially in a scenario where everyone tends to focus on the positive aspects and the functionalities that are working well. The QA tester adopts a different approach: they put themselves on the “wrong side” of the situation, intentionally looking for gaps that could compromise the user experience or the product’s performance. Pessimism and success.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.

Gabriella MoreiraGabriella Moreira,,"🔎🐞 My mindset as a QAProfessional pessimism?From my point of view, it’s a positive thing.A QA tester's professional pessimism isn’t about being demotivated or pessimistic in the classical sense. It’s about having an unwavering focus on anticipating problems before they visibly manifest! Before they become obstacles to the product’s success. This “walking on the wrong side” allows us to identify defects that other teams, often more optimistic, may overlook, especially in a scenario where everyone tends to focus on the positive aspects and the functionalities that are working well. The QA tester adopts a different approach: they put themselves on the “wrong side” of the situation, intentionally looking for gaps that could compromise the user experience or the product’s performance. Pessimism and success.

But the hardest part? Not knowing what exactly to fix.I spent months figuring it out and wasted a lot of time searching for the right resources. If I had to do this again, I wouldn’t prepare alone. Instead, I’d take help from senior QA Engineers. 🤝If you’re struggling to switch jobs, try preparing with seniors who've been through this journey. They can provide the roadmap I wish I had when I started. Connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/eTrMsvU8They already know what hiring managers look for, the test cases that actually get asked, and how to prepare for both coding and behavioral rounds.
