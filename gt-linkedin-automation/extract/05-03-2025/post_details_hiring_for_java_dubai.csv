Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

The new line would start at Ghubaiba near the Creek, run parallel to the coast through the northern part of Jumeirah, then turn inwards to Business Bay where it would cross the existing Red Line. The line will proceed through Business Bay towards Meydan, then through largely undeveloped land towards the terminal near Global Village.The Golden Line is an integral part of the Dubai TOD Strategy (by Egis).Info via MEED (link in comments)

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

In the interview, I share more on Egypt's position as a promising hub for exports to Europe, regional integration, the Egypt-Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, our shift from non-tradable to tradable sectors, & GDP growth expectations in the coming period.¬´ŸÑÿß ŸäŸèŸÖŸÉŸÜŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿµÿØŸÖÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿ™ŸÑŸÅÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿ≠ŸàŸÑŸÜÿßÿå ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáŸÖ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿ®ŸÜÿß ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ•ÿ∑ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÑŸä ÿ£ÿµÿ®ÿ≠ ÿ£ŸÉÿ´ÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ±Ÿãÿß ŸàŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ™ŸÜÿ®ÿ§ÿå Ÿàÿ™ŸÖŸÉŸÜÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇ ÿ£ŸáÿØÿßŸÅ ÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥Ÿäÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØŸäÿå ŸàŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖÿ±ŸàŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿ™ŸÜŸÅŸäÿ∞ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸáŸäŸÉŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™Ÿèÿπÿ≤ÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸàŸÜÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ∑ŸàŸäŸÑ¬ª.ŸÉÿßŸÜ Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿ° ŸÖŸÜ ŸÖŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ®ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ Marketplace Middle East ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿπŸÑÿßŸÖŸä ""ÿ±Ÿäÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿØ ŸÉŸàŸäÿ≥ÿ™"" ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÇŸÜÿßÿ© ÿ≥Ÿä ÿ•ŸÜ ÿ•ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑŸäÿ©.ÿÆŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´Ÿä ÿ£Ÿäÿ∂Ÿãÿßÿå ÿ£ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ™Ÿè ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ŸÖÿµÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ™Ÿäÿ¨Ÿä ŸàÿßŸÑÿ∞Ÿä Ÿäÿ¨ÿπŸÑŸáÿß ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤Ÿãÿß ÿ•ŸÇŸÑŸäŸÖŸäŸãÿß ŸàÿßÿπÿØŸãÿß ŸÑŸÑÿµÿßÿØÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ£Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ®ÿßÿå Ÿàÿ¨ŸáŸàÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÉÿßŸÖŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÇŸÑŸäŸÖŸä ŸàÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ®ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸáÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ¶Ÿä ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÖŸÑŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸäÿ©ÿå Ÿàÿ¨ŸáŸàÿØ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸÑ ŸáŸäŸÉŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿä ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∑ÿßÿπÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ™ÿØÿßŸàŸÑÿå Ÿàÿ™ŸàŸÇÿπÿßÿ™ ŸÜŸÖŸà ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ™ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ŸÑŸä ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ™ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿ®ŸÑÿ©.

Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Arushi NayakArushi Nayak,,"Best best best way to get our attention is make a crazy edit in the next one week and spam the entire team. Pro Tip - show us who YOU are in the edit. talk about something you care about. It could be about the 7 cups of chai (really unhealthy, speak to a professional) you look forward to everyday. It could be about your grandmas hands and how she churns every food item into a ball before popping it into her mouth. It could literally be about how you are feeling purposeless and want to actually really just be Katrina from ZNMD. (This seems personal.. pls ignore) We just want a good story man, with some experience in editing ofc. And i promise you (can‚Äôt actually do that), you‚Äôll be noticed. Worst/Best case, you actually made a crazy edit for yourself. You‚Äôll NEVER regret it. All love & chaos, Arushi

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

"Hanieh Arazmjoo, PhDHanieh Arazmjoo, PhD",,"The Secret to Winning in hashtag#Dubai? Stop Fighting. Start Creating. Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating. If you‚Äôre stuck in the Red Ocean, it‚Äôs time to rethink your strategy.hashtag#BlueOceanStrategy hashtag#CompetitiveStrategy hashtag#DubaiBusiness hashtag#MarketEntry hashtag#StrategicConsulting hashtag#ValueInnovation

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

"Hanieh Arazmjoo, PhDHanieh Arazmjoo, PhD",,"The Secret to Winning in hashtag#Dubai? Stop Fighting. Start Creating. Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating. If you‚Äôre stuck in the Red Ocean, it‚Äôs time to rethink your strategy.hashtag#BlueOceanStrategy hashtag#CompetitiveStrategy hashtag#DubaiBusiness hashtag#MarketEntry hashtag#StrategicConsulting hashtag#ValueInnovation

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

In the interview, I share more on Egypt's position as a promising hub for exports to Europe, regional integration, the Egypt-Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, our shift from non-tradable to tradable sectors, & GDP growth expectations in the coming period.¬´ŸÑÿß ŸäŸèŸÖŸÉŸÜŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿµÿØŸÖÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿ™ŸÑŸÅÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿ≠ŸàŸÑŸÜÿßÿå ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáŸÖ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿ®ŸÜÿß ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ•ÿ∑ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÑŸä ÿ£ÿµÿ®ÿ≠ ÿ£ŸÉÿ´ÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ±Ÿãÿß ŸàŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ™ŸÜÿ®ÿ§ÿå Ÿàÿ™ŸÖŸÉŸÜÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇ ÿ£ŸáÿØÿßŸÅ ÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥Ÿäÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØŸäÿå ŸàŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖÿ±ŸàŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿ™ŸÜŸÅŸäÿ∞ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸáŸäŸÉŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™Ÿèÿπÿ≤ÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸàŸÜÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ∑ŸàŸäŸÑ¬ª.ŸÉÿßŸÜ Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿ° ŸÖŸÜ ŸÖŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ®ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ Marketplace Middle East ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿπŸÑÿßŸÖŸä ""ÿ±Ÿäÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿØ ŸÉŸàŸäÿ≥ÿ™"" ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÇŸÜÿßÿ© ÿ≥Ÿä ÿ•ŸÜ ÿ•ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑŸäÿ©.ÿÆŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´Ÿä ÿ£Ÿäÿ∂Ÿãÿßÿå ÿ£ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ™Ÿè ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ŸÖÿµÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ™Ÿäÿ¨Ÿä ŸàÿßŸÑÿ∞Ÿä Ÿäÿ¨ÿπŸÑŸáÿß ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤Ÿãÿß ÿ•ŸÇŸÑŸäŸÖŸäŸãÿß ŸàÿßÿπÿØŸãÿß ŸÑŸÑÿµÿßÿØÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ£Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ®ÿßÿå Ÿàÿ¨ŸáŸàÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÉÿßŸÖŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÇŸÑŸäŸÖŸä ŸàÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ®ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸáÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ¶Ÿä ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÖŸÑŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸäÿ©ÿå Ÿàÿ¨ŸáŸàÿØ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸÑ ŸáŸäŸÉŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿä ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∑ÿßÿπÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ™ÿØÿßŸàŸÑÿå Ÿàÿ™ŸàŸÇÿπÿßÿ™ ŸÜŸÖŸà ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ™ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ŸÑŸä ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ™ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿ®ŸÑÿ©.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

"Hanieh Arazmjoo, PhDHanieh Arazmjoo, PhD",,"The Secret to Winning in hashtag#Dubai? Stop Fighting. Start Creating. Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating. If you‚Äôre stuck in the Red Ocean, it‚Äôs time to rethink your strategy.hashtag#BlueOceanStrategy hashtag#CompetitiveStrategy hashtag#DubaiBusiness hashtag#MarketEntry hashtag#StrategicConsulting hashtag#ValueInnovation

Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating. If you‚Äôre stuck in the Red Ocean, it‚Äôs time to rethink your strategy.hashtag#BlueOceanStrategy hashtag#CompetitiveStrategy hashtag#DubaiBusiness hashtag#MarketEntry hashtag#StrategicConsulting hashtag#ValueInnovation

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean?

Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean?

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

Patrick ZenkerPatrick Zenker,,"‚ÄòHappiness is a habit‚Äô or how I rediscovered with confidence. With my return after 32days to cool Europe (politically and weather-wise), my mental strenght recovered and my motivation is back. This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating.

Michael J.Michael J.,,"Aviation:   Etihad will push back $1 billion IPO launch to at least next monthEtihad Airways has reportedly delayed its highly anticipated $1 billion IPO until after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking a shift in the timeline for what would be the first major Gulf airline listing in nearly two decades.The airline has been on an impressive turnaround journey, tripling its net profit to $476 million last year after years of restructuring. Under the leadership of CEO Antonoaldo Neves, Etihad has strengthened its position in the global aviation market and was set to offer 20% of its business to fund future growth.While no official reason has been given for the delay, this IPO has the potential to be a bright spot for investors in an industry facing supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and rising costs. With Abu Dhabi‚Äôs $225B wealth fund ADQ backing the airline, all eyes are on the next move.Is this delay a strategic decision to time the market better, or a sign of underlying challenges?https://lnkd.in/dmY8upzJhashtag#aviation hashtag#IPO hashtag#Etihad hashtag#investment

This educational tour was a stunning or as Omar said at the very first night in Lilly's Bar ""Take off the German face and put on the Dubai face"". I am sure I was good in fast adaption & transformation. Do people actually smell you are travelling with no plans, but like to enjoy contact with everyone or simply that you just now have time for personal contact?I see entrepreneurs, against all odds, topping success in every new year because subconscious attitudes trained & trimmed for it - every day new. I feel more than confirmed that an entrepreneurial mindset is the basis for success in any form. I now understand why young people, entrepreneurs and simply people from all over the world have identified this part of the world for themselves.¬†The legal framework is a safe heaven, to deploy from here. It reminded me of the importance of positive thinking and a can-do mentality. Europe, and my own Germany, is in a sandwhich position when it comes to attitude and decisiveness. In the Emirates, the water boils at 100 degrees, the diversity of nations is extremly wide and the sun rises and sets. It is the view that counts and an environment which lead you to greatest performance. Back with a fresh reality, the plan now is to put learning into practice.

Eureka! GCCEureka! GCC,,"The Economic Impact of Ramadan on the GCC RegionRamadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, brings spiritual significance, fostering unity, generosity, and reflection. In the GCC countries, it also shapes economic trends, influencing stock markets, consumer behavior, and guiding government policies to align with faith, charity, and social well-being.During Ramadan, GCC stock markets witness shifts due to altered investor routines and spiritual focus. In 2024, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) saw a slight 0.21% dip, closing at 4,244.15 points. Despite this, the broader MSCI GCC Index recorded a 0.7% annual gain, demonstrating resilience. Among companies that saw gains, talabat mart, Careem, and noon experienced increased consumer engagement, while luxury retail brands and high-end dining establishments saw a slowdown.Ramadan significantly impacts consumer spending, tourism, and e-commerce. In 2024, GCC consumer spending surged by 15-20% in the weeks leading up to Ramadan, driven by increased demand for food, clothing, and gifts. Religious tourism flourished, with Umrah pilgrimage numbers rising by 30% in Saudi Arabia. E-commerce saw an 18% increase in transactions, with grocery and clothing sales leading the trend. Hotels and restaurants adapted with special suhoor and iftar services, boosting food and beverage revenues.Ramadan fuels the startup ecosystem, particularly in digital solutions, fintech, and e-commerce. Barakah Tech, a halal fintech platform, and SABEEL, a charity crowdfunding startup, reported a surge in users. However, ride-hailing companies like Swvl saw a dip in demand as people reduced non-essential travel during fasting hours.GCC governments introduce various policies to accommodate economic and social shifts:- Reduced Working Hours: Employees receive a two-hour workday reduction to balance work and religious observance.- Price Regulations: Essential goods, including over 80 key food products in Saudi Arabia, are monitored to ensure affordability.- Welfare and Charity: The UAE recorded AED 1.5 billion (USD 410 million) in charitable donations in 2024.- Transport Adjustments: Dubai‚Äôs metro and bus services saw a 15% increase in evening usage to accommodate Ramadan schedules.Ramadan fosters self-discipline, gratitude, and empathy, values reflected in economic policies and trends. Reduced market activity signals a shift from material pursuits to spiritual enrichment, while fair pricing and increased charity reinforce social justice and community welfare. The emphasis on generosity leads to heightened corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.GCC economies integrate Ramadan‚Äôs principles into their economic frameworks, ensuring stability while upholding spiritual values. What lessons can businesses in your country take from Ramadan‚Äôs economic shifts to better navigate major festivals?

Many businesses entering Dubai get stuck in competition mode‚Äîprice wars, endless discounts, and trying to ""be better"" than others. But the real winners don‚Äôt compete. They create.This is the essence of Blue Ocean Strategy‚Äîwhere you escape competition by redefining the game itself. Recently, I've realized my clients don't fully understand the concept of hashtag#blueoceanstrategy. Here‚Äôs how businesses can apply it in Dubai‚Äôs fast-moving market:‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúMarket Share‚Äù to ‚ÄúMarket Creation‚ÄùMost brands chase a small slice of an existing market. Instead, create a new category.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another luxury coffee chain, what about a high-end, AI-driven personalized coffee experience?‚úÖ Break Industry BoundariesStop thinking in industry silos. Instead, combine elements from different markets to create something new.- What do I mean? Look at The Museum of the Future‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a museum to showcase the past, it‚Äôs a global think tank, a brand, and an experience hub all in one.‚úÖ Make Competition Irrelevant by Changing the RulesInstead of playing by existing industry standards, redefine what customers expect.- What do I mean? Instead of being another logistics company, what about offering a premium, hassle-free white-glove delivery service for high-net-worth clients?‚úÖ Find & Unlock Non-CustomersThe biggest opportunities lie in serving people who never considered your industry before.- What do I mean? Instead of launching another fintech app for banking, what about a wealth-tech platform designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners?‚úÖ Leverage Dubai‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst-Mover‚Äù AdvantageDubai is built on bold, first-mover ideas. Success isn‚Äôt about being slightly better; it‚Äôs about being radically different.- What do I mean? Look at @expo2020 in Dubai. It wasn‚Äôt just another expo‚Äîit became a global platform for innovation, sustainability, and business networking.How You Can Apply This in Your Business?‚úÖ Look for gaps‚ÄîWhat are competitors ignoring?‚úÖ Redefine value‚ÄîWhat problems can you solve differently?‚úÖ Think local‚ÄîDubai rewards businesses that adapt to its unique ecosystem.The biggest opportunities in Dubai belong to those who stop competing and start innovating.
