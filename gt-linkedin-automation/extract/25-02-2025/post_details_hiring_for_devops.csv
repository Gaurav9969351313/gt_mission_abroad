Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks.

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap?

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap?

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Isaac IllamIsaac Illam,,"Too many resumes, not enough right-fit candidates? A trusted staffing partner helps cut through the noise—saving time, connecting you to top talent, and streamlining hiring.  Here’s how:"
Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices? What does your ideal hiring process look like?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Isaac IllamIsaac Illam,,"Too many resumes, not enough right-fit candidates? A trusted staffing partner helps cut through the noise—saving time, connecting you to top talent, and streamlining hiring.  Here’s how:"
Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help.

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

This problem was a fun mix of graph theory, path optimization, and game strategy!Alice and Bob move in opposite directions, so we need to track Bob’s path first.Bob’s presence at a node impacts Alice’s profit, meaning we must adjust the rewards/costs dynamically.Alice should traverse optimally towards a leaf node, maximizing her net income.𝓚𝓮𝔂 𝓞𝓫𝓼𝓮𝓻𝓿𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷𝓼:If Bob reaches a node before Alice, Alice gets no income from it.If Alice and Bob reach a node simultaneously, the reward is split equally.If Alice reaches a node first, she collects the full reward.Leaf nodes are Alice’s stopping points, so she should choose the most profitable one.🛠 𝓐𝓹𝓹𝓻𝓸𝓪𝓬𝓱1️⃣ 𝓖𝓻𝓪𝓹𝓱 𝓒𝓸𝓷𝓼𝓽𝓻𝓾𝓬𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷 (𝓐𝓭𝓳𝓪𝓬𝓮𝓷𝓬𝔂 𝓛𝓲𝓼𝓽)Convert edges into a tree representation using an adjacency list.2️⃣ 𝓣𝓻𝓪𝓬𝓴 𝓑𝓸𝓫’𝓼 𝓟𝓪𝓽𝓱 𝓤𝓼𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝓓𝓕𝓢Perform DFS from Bob’s starting node to track when he reaches each node.Store Bob’s arrival times to help adjust Alice’s rewards later.3️⃣ 𝓕𝓲𝓷𝓭 𝓐𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓮’𝓼 𝓜𝓸𝓼𝓽 𝓟𝓻𝓸𝓯𝓲𝓽𝓪𝓫𝓵𝓮 𝓟𝓪𝓽𝓱 𝓤𝓼𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝓓𝓕𝓢Start DFS from node 0 and traverse towards leaf nodes.Adjust rewards dynamically based on Bob’s presence at each node.Keep track of the maximum profit Alice can achieve.🌍 𝓡𝓮𝓪𝓵-𝓦𝓸𝓻𝓵𝓭 𝓐𝓹𝓹𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷𝓼1️⃣ 𝓞𝓹𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓲𝔃𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝓖𝓪𝓼 𝓕𝓮𝓮𝓼 𝓲𝓷 𝓔𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓻𝓮𝓾𝓶 & 𝓛𝓪𝔂𝓮𝓻 2 𝓢𝓬𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓷𝓰𝓟𝓻𝓸𝓫𝓵𝓮𝓶: Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion and transaction paths.𝓐𝓹𝓹𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷: This algorithm can be used to find the cheapest path for transactions by modeling blockchain networks as a graph where nodes represent miners or validators, and edges represent transaction propagation costs.𝓔𝔁𝓪𝓶𝓹𝓵𝓮: Choosing the most cost-effective validator on Ethereum or Layer 2 networks (Optimism, Arbitrum) to minimize gas fees.2️⃣ 𝓡𝓮𝓲𝓷𝓯𝓸𝓻𝓬𝓮𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽 𝓛𝓮𝓪𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 & 𝓞𝓹𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓪𝓵 𝓓𝓮𝓬𝓲𝓼𝓲𝓸𝓷-𝓜𝓪𝓴𝓲𝓷𝓰𝓟𝓻𝓸𝓫𝓵𝓮𝓶: In reinforcement learning, an AI agent must make sequential decisions to maximize rewards while avoiding penalties.𝓐𝓹𝓹𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷: The algorithm can model optimal decision paths where an AI agent selects actions that maximize long-term rewards, similar to how Alice chooses the best leaf node in the problem.𝓔𝔁𝓪𝓶𝓹𝓵𝓮: Game AI in chess, robotics, or self-learning agents optimizing their moves based on environment rewards. hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#Algorithms hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Python hashtag#DynamicProgramming hashtag#PathOptimization hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AutonomousVehicles hashtag#Networking hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Optimization hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#GameDevelopment hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#Logistics hashtag#AI hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#blockchain

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

Shauna W.Shauna W.,,"Employees at GSA received notification of initiation of RIF procedures this evening. OPM will also be asked to approve the offer of VERAs under the process.Federal News Network: https://lnkd.in/gBU6Tx3gTerms to READ MORE ABOUT:▶️ Competitive Area (p.29) -- the boundaries within which employees compete for retention under the RIF regulations. The competitive area includes all employees within the organizational unit(s) and geographical location(s) that are included in the competitive area definition. In any one RIF, an agency may not use one competitive area for the first round of competition, and a different competitive area for the second round of competition. ▶️ Competitive Level (p.34) -- groups of interchangeable positions. When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench

When the agency applies the four RIF retention factors (tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level, the competitive level becomes a retention register, which lists employees in the order of their relative retention standing. The terms “competitive level” and “retention register” are generally used in reference to a final retention register without regard to this distinction. ▶️ Retention Register (p.38) -- applies the four retention factors required by law (i.e., tenure, veterans’ preference, length of service, and performance ratings) to the competitive level. The retention register lists all competing employees in the order of their relative retention standing in a single competitive level. ▶️ Retention Standing (p.39) -- The four statutory retention factors are implemented in the following order on the retention register: 1.	 Tenure (p.39) -- implemented through three tenure groups; 2.	 Veterans’ preference (p.42) -- three tenure subgroups on the retention register; 3.	 RIF Service Date (p.44) -- employee’s service computation date on the retention register; and4.	 Performance (p.45) -- additional service  added for retention to the employee’s service computation date on the retention register. ▶️ Bump and Retreat Rights (p.58) -- three types of potential assignment rights to positions in different competitive levels through assignment by: “Bumping"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee in a lower retention tenure group, or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group“Retreating"" -- assignment to a position in a different competitive level held by another employee with less service in the same retention subgroup.Offers of vacant positions, which are based on the same retention standing procedures that apply to an employee’s bump and retreat rights.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🔎 Rethinking Hiring for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Roles 🚀In 2025, the tech landscape has evolved significantly. AI is no longer an option but a policy in many organizations, seamlessly integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to enhance code quality, automate processes, and improve efficiency.Yet, many companies still insist on 7-day-long coding assessments 📝 as part of the hiring process for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles—positions where coding is rarely the primary responsibility. This raises critical questions:📌 Does this reflect the real-world work environment?📌 Why are we assessing senior engineers with tasks AI can complete in seconds?📌 Isn't experience, problem-solving, and system design more valuable than syntax-heavy coding?🔍 Evidence & Trends:✅ AI-Driven Development: According to a 2024 Stack Overflow report, 75%+ of engineers use AI tools like Copilot & ChatGPT to optimize coding tasks.✅ Industry Shift: Companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon integrate AI-assisted development, focusing on problem-solving over raw coding skills.✅ Hiring Reality: DevOps & SRE roles demand infrastructure expertise, automation, observability, and resilience engineering—not just coding fluency.⚠️ The Hiring Paradox:While AI is revolutionizing how engineers work, hiring processes remain outdated. Companies demand speed and innovation yet enforce rigid, manual, and time-consuming assessments that don’t measure real-world capabilities.---🌍 The Perfect Hiring Process – If We Lived in a Perfect World🔹 📞 Intro Chat (30 min) – A real conversation with a hiring manager or lead engineer. Focus on expectations, team culture, and candidate experience, not just “tell me about yourself.”🔹 🛠️ Hands-On Technical Discussion (1 hour) – A collaborative session where candidates walk through their experience, explain past projects, system architecture, and troubleshooting strategies.🔹 ⚡ Real-World Problem Solving (45 min) – A live infrastructure challenge, like debugging a failing deployment, optimizing observability, or discussing scaling strategies. No unnecessary whiteboard coding!🔹 🤝 Team Fit & Culture (30 min) – A peer-to-peer conversation to ensure alignment with team values, communication, and collaboration style.🔹 🚀 Decision in <1 Week – Transparent feedback within days, not weeks. No unpaid take-home projects, just efficient, respectful hiring.---🛠️ It's Time to Evolve Hiring!What are your thoughts? Have you faced outdated hiring practices?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🏢 Why is Every Startup Trying to Be ""Google""? 🤔In the tech world, every startup dreams of becoming ""the next Google."" From internal culture to team structure and even the tech stack—everyone is trying to replicate Google. But is this always a good thing? Let’s break it down:📌 🚀 Google’s Influence on Startups:🔹 Engineering Architecture: Many startups adopt Microservices, Kubernetes, and Big Data Pipelines, just like Google—even if they don’t actually need that complexity.🔹 Company Culture: From flat hierarchies to the famous ""20% time for side projects,"" companies try to mimic Google’s work environment, often struggling due to different resources and scales.🔹 Hiring & Evaluation: Google’s System Design Interviews and Leetcode-style coding challenges have become industry standards, making it harder for new talent to break in.🔹 Innovation Obsession: Every startup wants to launch the next revolutionary product, but even Google has had major failures like Google+ and Stadia, proving that copying doesn’t guarantee success.📌 ⚖️ When Does Copying Google Make Sense?✅ If you're a large-scale company needing massive scalability.✅ If you're working on high-traffic SaaS platforms that demand Google-like infrastructure.✅ If you're adopting an innovation mindset, not just blindly following their playbook.📌 ⛔ When Is It a Mistake?❌ If you're a small startup that needs simplicity over complexity.❌ If you're using Google's practices without understanding why they work for them.❌ If you're adopting over-engineered solutions just because they’re ""the industry standard.""🔹 💡 The Bottom Line:Google is an incredible company, but its success didn’t come just from Kubernetes, remote work, or tough hiring processes—it came from vision, execution, and continuous iteration. If you're a startup, ask yourself: Do I need to be like Google, or do I need to be the best version of myself?💬 Do you think startups benefit from copying Google, or are they falling into an unnecessary complexity trap? Share your thoughts! 👇hashtag#GoogleEffect hashtag#Startups hashtag#TechCulture hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Entrepreneurship 🚀

Pradip ShahPradip Shah,,"Magento needs the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"".In my talk with customers, I have found that, when they think of Magento, they think of expensive downtimes during code deployments. Many are attracted to SaaS as they do not have to worry about code deploys. Magento merchants need to be given the confidence of ""deploy-at-will"". Friday evening or during a sales event. Recently David Lambauer posted about the scare of Friday deploys. His post and my response made me write down luroConnect's CI/CD and processes that have improved over the years and continue to improve with my discussions with developers and community.I had also conducted a workshop on this topic at hashtag#MM25IN and had received very good feedback.Highlights :• Build without db strategy. I believe is the key! You get repeatable builds. It also helps Magento hosting become more compliant to the 12factor app.• You can now use a build machine and not load the production system.• Easy, one click rollbacks, just in case something went wrong• ~0 downtime deployments - facilitated by using a softlink to the web folder and relinking media and var. • Builds are done clean each time - starting with a git clone on an empty folder. No prior build artifacts hanging around. This reduces technical debt as find when we onboard customers - composer.lock not committed for example.• Staging server with an ability to restore live db ensures builds are tested with as near production as possible, reducing possibility of a bad deploy• Patch buids : Taking a few files live without the need for a full build. You can rollback patches as they are fully deployed builds.https://lnkd.in/gEA647dB

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Enyioma NwadibiaEnyioma Nwadibia,,"💡 3 DevOps Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier 💡When I started my journey as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I thought mastering tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD was all I needed. But experience has taught me some valuable lessons that go beyond just the tech.Here are 3 key lessons I wish I knew earlier:🔹 1. Simplicity > ComplexityJust because you can deploy a fully automated multi-cluster Kubernetes setup doesn’t mean you should. The best solutions are often the simplest ones that meet business needs.🔹 2. Automation is NOT a One-Time TaskBuilding a CI/CD pipeline or an infrastructure-as-code setup is great—but it’s never ""done."" Things change, and continuous improvement is part of the DevOps mindset.🔹 3. Logs & Monitoring Save LivesNo matter how good your deployment strategy is, things will break. The key to quick recovery is good observability—logs, metrics, and alerts (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, etc.). If you can’t see what’s happening, you can’t fix it fast.I’ll be sharing more insights like this every week. Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀👉 What’s one DevOps lesson you’ve learned the hard way?

"Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)Petrina Frost, MBA (HR Mgt)",,"Insights from LinkedIn Poll on Job Transition TimesI recently conducted a poll on LinkedIn to understand how long people typically expect to be between roles. The results were quite revealing and offer several insights into the current job market dynamics.A significant 37% of respondents indicated that their transition between roles was around 6 weeks. Meanwhile, 26% of participants reported a gap of around 3 months. This period could reflect the average time it takes for a thorough job search, including the application process and multiple rounds of interviews.Interestingly, 21% of respondents experienced a 6-month gap between roles. This longer duration might be attributed to more challenging job markets or specific industry requirements.Finally, 16% of those surveyed expressed feeling stuck on the bench and needing help. This emphasizes the importance of robust career support systems, networking opportunities, and perhaps a focus on upskilling to enhance employability. Those connections who indicated they’re stuck on the bench - please reach out if you need to talk!hashtag#contractorlife hashtag#onthebench
