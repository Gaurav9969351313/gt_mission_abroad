Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

"Tayo DAVIES, MBBS, BCMASTayo DAVIES, MBBS, BCMAS",,"Job offers may not always come through.Keeping relationships can however open unexpected doors.A friend applied to a top company last year.After two interview rounds, hiring was frozen.Instead of moving on completely,she kept in touch with the hiring manager, and other employees she met. Months later, she applied for a role in a different company,and reached out to that same manager for insights.Turns out, they knew who was leading the hiring there and put in a good word for her.She got to interview, aced it and landed the job!Lesson?

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

Don't cut ties even if you don't get the offer.Express gratitude.Be gracious.Keep in touch, and nurture professional relationships.You never know where they might lead!📸 (ChatGPT 4-o, Feb 2025)_____________________________________________________𝙏𝙖𝙮𝙤 𝘿𝘼𝙑𝙄𝙀𝙎,🆂🅲🅸🅴🅽🅲🅴 🅸🅽 🅰 🆂🆄🅸🆃 ——————————————————————Loved this post ?

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

Oleg ZherlitsynOleg Zherlitsyn,,"Why People Miscalculate Their Chances of Getting an OfferWhen applying for jobs, many candidates try to estimate their probability of getting an offer. However, their calculations are often incorrect. Let’s analyze why this happens using parsing data from January and March 2024, covering 486 companies, with a variance of 37 and a correlation of 13.The Illusion of ProbabilityMost people approach job applications as a simple probability problem: “I applied to 10 companies, got 2 interviews, so I have a 20% chance of success.” However, real-world hiring doesn’t work like rolling dice. There are interconnected factors at play that make such calculations misleading.Variance and the Chaos of HiringA variance of 37 in our dataset suggests significant fluctuations in hiring processes across different companies. Some firms may be hiring aggressively, while others might pause recruitment unexpectedly. Assuming all companies behave the same way ignores these variations.Correlation and Hidden DependenciesA correlation of 13 (when normalized) indicates that hiring decisions are not independent. Your application at one company can influence another—through shared applicant tracking systems, recruiter networks, or even the improvement of your resume after multiple interview rounds. If you assume independent probabilities, you are likely miscalculating your odds.

"Tayo DAVIES, MBBS, BCMASTayo DAVIES, MBBS, BCMAS",,"Job offers may not always come through.Keeping relationships can however open unexpected doors.A friend applied to a top company last year.After two interview rounds, hiring was frozen.Instead of moving on completely,she kept in touch with the hiring manager, and other employees she met. Months later, she applied for a role in a different company,and reached out to that same manager for insights.Turns out, they knew who was leading the hiring there and put in a good word for her.She got to interview, aced it and landed the job!Lesson? Don't cut ties even if you don't get the offer.Express gratitude.Be gracious.Keep in touch, and nurture professional relationships.You never know where they might lead!📸 (ChatGPT 4-o, Feb 2025)_____________________________________________________𝙏𝙖𝙮𝙤 𝘿𝘼𝙑𝙄𝙀𝙎,🆂🅲🅸🅴🅽🅲🅴 🅸🅽 🅰 🆂🆄🅸🆃 ——————————————————————Loved this post ?

I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.

Oleg ZherlitsynOleg Zherlitsyn,,"Why People Miscalculate Their Chances of Getting an OfferWhen applying for jobs, many candidates try to estimate their probability of getting an offer. However, their calculations are often incorrect. Let’s analyze why this happens using parsing data from January and March 2024, covering 486 companies, with a variance of 37 and a correlation of 13.The Illusion of ProbabilityMost people approach job applications as a simple probability problem: “I applied to 10 companies, got 2 interviews, so I have a 20% chance of success.” However, real-world hiring doesn’t work like rolling dice. There are interconnected factors at play that make such calculations misleading.Variance and the Chaos of HiringA variance of 37 in our dataset suggests significant fluctuations in hiring processes across different companies. Some firms may be hiring aggressively, while others might pause recruitment unexpectedly. Assuming all companies behave the same way ignores these variations.Correlation and Hidden DependenciesA correlation of 13 (when normalized) indicates that hiring decisions are not independent. Your application at one company can influence another—through shared applicant tracking systems, recruiter networks, or even the improvement of your resume after multiple interview rounds. If you assume independent probabilities, you are likely miscalculating your odds.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

Oleg ZherlitsynOleg Zherlitsyn,,"Why People Miscalculate Their Chances of Getting an OfferWhen applying for jobs, many candidates try to estimate their probability of getting an offer. However, their calculations are often incorrect. Let’s analyze why this happens using parsing data from January and March 2024, covering 486 companies, with a variance of 37 and a correlation of 13.The Illusion of ProbabilityMost people approach job applications as a simple probability problem: “I applied to 10 companies, got 2 interviews, so I have a 20% chance of success.” However, real-world hiring doesn’t work like rolling dice. There are interconnected factors at play that make such calculations misleading.Variance and the Chaos of HiringA variance of 37 in our dataset suggests significant fluctuations in hiring processes across different companies. Some firms may be hiring aggressively, while others might pause recruitment unexpectedly. Assuming all companies behave the same way ignores these variations.Correlation and Hidden DependenciesA correlation of 13 (when normalized) indicates that hiring decisions are not independent. Your application at one company can influence another—through shared applicant tracking systems, recruiter networks, or even the improvement of your resume after multiple interview rounds. If you assume independent probabilities, you are likely miscalculating your odds.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

Oleg ZherlitsynOleg Zherlitsyn,,"Why People Miscalculate Their Chances of Getting an OfferWhen applying for jobs, many candidates try to estimate their probability of getting an offer. However, their calculations are often incorrect. Let’s analyze why this happens using parsing data from January and March 2024, covering 486 companies, with a variance of 37 and a correlation of 13.The Illusion of ProbabilityMost people approach job applications as a simple probability problem: “I applied to 10 companies, got 2 interviews, so I have a 20% chance of success.” However, real-world hiring doesn’t work like rolling dice. There are interconnected factors at play that make such calculations misleading.Variance and the Chaos of HiringA variance of 37 in our dataset suggests significant fluctuations in hiring processes across different companies. Some firms may be hiring aggressively, while others might pause recruitment unexpectedly. Assuming all companies behave the same way ignores these variations.Correlation and Hidden DependenciesA correlation of 13 (when normalized) indicates that hiring decisions are not independent. Your application at one company can influence another—through shared applicant tracking systems, recruiter networks, or even the improvement of your resume after multiple interview rounds. If you assume independent probabilities, you are likely miscalculating your odds.

Jordan LambertJordan Lambert,,"Let’s talk about dealing with numtpties on the internet Because ‘the best revenge is success’ and luckily I am a better coach than what I was as a recruiter Dualta Doherty did a post saying how it’s a red flag if a candidate doesn’t reply to you fast. I disagree - people have lives and there is more to life than the world of recruitment Imagine thinking you, as a recruiter is more important than someone’s work life balance,Than looking after their sick kids,To be focusing on delivering a projectEtc, than trying to reply quicklyThere is always reasons why someone might be ‘slow’ at replying. That is ok… He than turned to make it personal. Reality is during Covid, I was working Blue Collar Commerical Maintaince - quite hard to recruit for cleaners for the commerical sector when the commercial sector is shut… During Covid I started coaching a few people for free and found so much more happiness from doing this than I ever did in recruitment Why I actually because a coach, because I love health and fitness and helping people level up in life. So why would I have gone back to recruitment after furlough? Financially I was making more money than what most recruiters make in the first year (plus I was living in Holland which was pretty sound) Regardless how you do in life What you achieve You’ll always have someone like Dualta try to pull you down to make themselves feel better.  Ignore that hate and focus on youCould I have made it as a recruiter? Who knows & who cares

Oleg ZherlitsynOleg Zherlitsyn,,"Why People Miscalculate Their Chances of Getting an OfferWhen applying for jobs, many candidates try to estimate their probability of getting an offer. However, their calculations are often incorrect. Let’s analyze why this happens using parsing data from January and March 2024, covering 486 companies, with a variance of 37 and a correlation of 13.The Illusion of ProbabilityMost people approach job applications as a simple probability problem: “I applied to 10 companies, got 2 interviews, so I have a 20% chance of success.” However, real-world hiring doesn’t work like rolling dice. There are interconnected factors at play that make such calculations misleading.Variance and the Chaos of HiringA variance of 37 in our dataset suggests significant fluctuations in hiring processes across different companies. Some firms may be hiring aggressively, while others might pause recruitment unexpectedly. Assuming all companies behave the same way ignores these variations.Correlation and Hidden DependenciesA correlation of 13 (when normalized) indicates that hiring decisions are not independent. Your application at one company can influence another—through shared applicant tracking systems, recruiter networks, or even the improvement of your resume after multiple interview rounds. If you assume independent probabilities, you are likely miscalculating your odds.
