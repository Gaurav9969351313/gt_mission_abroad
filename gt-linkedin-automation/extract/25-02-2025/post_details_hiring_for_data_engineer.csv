Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?

Traverse ClaytonTraverse Clayton,,"🎙️Solid podcast on VC20 with Groq founder Jonathan Ross. He may be a cyborg with LPUs implanted in his brain. A lot of ground was covered including: Big O notation applied to org scaling, Keynesian beauty contests, 7 powers, mopeds and freight trains, hiring for loss bias, financial diabetes, and challenge coins. I rarely re-listen to a podcast, but may be forced to on this one. I went old school and took manual notes to sear it into my brain. Here’s my TL;DR: ✔️ Plan for Better, Faster, and Cheaper AI: Founders should build with the assumption that AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially. Scaling laws matter more than short-term optimizations.✔️ AI Growth Bottlenecks: The three biggest constraints on AI growth: data, algorithms, and compute power. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) supply is a critical chokepoint, and power availability is the biggest limiting factor.✔️ The Inference Wars: NVIDIA dominates training but Groq is leading inference, offering 5x lower cost and 1/3rd the energy per token. The real battlefield is tokens per dollar and tokens per watt, not raw TFLOPs.✔️ Datacenters Are Energy, Not Just Real Estate: The AI race isn’t about who has the best chips, but about who controls the power. Inference demand is 20x larger than training, and in 3-4 years, power constraints will slow AI more than chip shortages.✔️ AI Business Models Must Optimize for Scale, Not Spend: Startups shouldn’t focus on spending more; they should focus on how much they can scale efficiently. NVIDIA enjoys 70-80% margins, Groq operates at 20% but prioritizes speed and scale.✔️ The Big O of Organization scale and hiring: AI startups should scale teams logarithmically, not linearly. If customer growth doubles, you shouldn’t need to double your employees. Use automation to scale. Hire generalists that book the win early (i.e. loss bias).✔️ China and Europe: China is winning through brute force deployment of compute, but talent that wants to innovate is likely to leave due to government constraints. Europe lacks an AI “Silicon Valley” due to risk aversion and needs a ""Risk-On"" enclave to foster AI breakthroughs.✔️ The Path to AGI? Solving Hallucinations is critical. Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning systems) comes after this milestone, but hallucination errors must be solved before AI can truly replace high-risk human decision-making.✔️ The Economics of AI: More money will be made than incinerated in the long-term. AI is in a Keynesian beauty contest, where marketing and hype matter as much as technology. Most AI startups will fail, but the winners will dominate markets for decades.✔️ The Future of AI: The real economic opportunity isn’t in training models but in owning infrastructure, inference, and execution. Prompt engineering will drive the next wave of creativity and business innovation and not constrain extraction of AI value just to engineers.

Ayesha MangeraAyesha Mangera,,"The secret sauce that separates good data analysts from great ones isn't found in code or algorithms - it's the ability to transform complex insights into stories that inspire action.𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀When working with technical or non-technical stakeholders, your ability to craft a compelling narrative that guides them from business problems to actionable outcomes becomes invaluable. However, effective storytelling requires understanding the six W's framework (Why, Whom, What, How, When and Where).Kate Greenbook explains this nicely in her book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸, which covers how to create genuine business impact through data stories and how we approach stakeholder communications.𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻Many organisations focus exclusively on tools or documentation, but is that truly the best approach? Without a deep understanding of business requirements, making truly data-driven decisions becomes nearly impossible.Data-driven decisions rely on better analysis techniques. You can take many different approaches, but if you need a quick analysis using Python, have read Bradford Tuckfield's 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲. Whether you're learning Python fundamentals, seeking analysis techniques that drive business value, or simply refreshing core concepts, this resource breaks everything down efficiently - covering simple visualising to forecasting, group comparison, A/B testing and much more.𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮For years, we have primarily worked with structured data and traditional data warehouses. But times are changing. With AI and machine learning advancements, organisations increasingly leverage unstructured and text-based data. This evolution is not just a change, but an exciting opportunity to explore new frontiers in data analysis.𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲As technology and people evolve, organisations must adapt. If you haven't read 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘀𝗲? I highly recommend it. This classic brilliantly illustrates different approaches to change through its characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. It's a reminder of the necessity and urgency of adapting to change in our fast-paced, data-driven world.Love your thoughts on,🤔What challenges have you faced when communicating data insights to technical or non-technical stakeholders? 🌟What's your favourite AI tool/chatbot for quickly writing code?
