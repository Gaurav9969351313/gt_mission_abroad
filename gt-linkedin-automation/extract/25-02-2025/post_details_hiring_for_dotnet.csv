Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

Joshua KiddJoshua Kidd,,"Happy Monday, LinkedIn friends!I'm sharing my thoughts again as a job seeker to keep the energy up during these changing times. I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

Joshua KiddJoshua Kidd,,"Happy Monday, LinkedIn friends!I'm sharing my thoughts again as a job seeker to keep the energy up during these changing times. I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health. A daily workout has really helped me feel better, both mentally and physically, and I’ll need those well-fitting work pants soon!Im attaching my updated resume with on this platform for reac.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

They won't ask you too but do it, Be like Darshen Singh :) (thanks bro)Also if you're going for a role that someone else you know is going for support them - After all, if one of you gets that role it's a win in my books, isn't it.

Joshua KiddJoshua Kidd,,"Happy Monday, LinkedIn friends!I'm sharing my thoughts again as a job seeker to keep the energy up during these changing times. I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health. A daily workout has really helped me feel better, both mentally and physically, and I’ll need those well-fitting work pants soon!Im attaching my updated resume with on this platform for reac.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

If you meet at least 70% of the qualifications, go ahead and apply! 🎯 Many talented individuals self-disqualify, thinking they need to be a 100% match. That's not the case! I can testify!💡 At Microsoft, our managers, recruiters and hiring committees are trained to focus on candidates who align closely with most of the job requirements, not all. 📚👀🛠️ As a seasoned IT professional who learned this the hard way early on in my IT career, I'm here to tell you—give yourself a chance! It might just be the break you need. 🌈 When I applied to Microsoft, I knew I didn't fully meet the job requirements.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Carrie BrysonCarrie Bryson,,"🎯 Progress, Not Perfection! 🎯Job searching can feel like a rollercoaster—some days you’re riding high, and other days, it feels like you’re stuck at the bottom. But here’s the secret: progress is what gets you to the top. Maybe you didn’t land the job yet, but last week, you:✅ Updated your LinkedIn profile✅ Sent out a few applications✅ Practiced answering tough interview questions✅ Made a new connection✅ Researched five companies you’d love to work for✅ Updated your resume to better showcase your value✅ Had a conversation with someone at a target companyThese steps matter. They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script. Instead of focusing on what didn’t happen, tell me—what’s one thing you accomplished last week that brought you closer to your goal?

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Joshua KiddJoshua Kidd,,"Happy Monday, LinkedIn friends!I'm sharing my thoughts again as a job seeker to keep the energy up during these changing times. I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

There's a delicate balance when delivering a component like this to the engineering team. Each node had to be carefully weighted. What you don't see in this shot is that the timeline is divided into three equal parts. I accounted for future iterations by testing different character counts on headings, that was just one of the many many things I needed to account for. Again, lots more to discuss, reach out for more. **Interesting early results: Weekend posts are underperforming in terms of views.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

There's a delicate balance when delivering a component like this to the engineering team. Each node had to be carefully weighted. What you don't see in this shot is that the timeline is divided into three equal parts. I accounted for future iterations by testing different character counts on headings, that was just one of the many many things I needed to account for. Again, lots more to discuss, reach out for more. **Interesting early results: Weekend posts are underperforming in terms of views. More data is needed, and this probably comes as no surprise, but it's looking like weekdays are the sweet spot for visibility.hashtag#productdesignhashtag#productdesignjobs hashtag#uxjobs hashtag#hireme hashtag#opentoworkBacklink to post 5 of 30: https://lnkd.in/gJSApsK3

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

But here’s the secret: progress is what gets you to the top.

They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later.

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Carrie BrysonCarrie Bryson,,"🎯 Progress, Not Perfection! 🎯Job searching can feel like a rollercoaster—some days you’re riding high, and other days, it feels like you’re stuck at the bottom. But here’s the secret: progress is what gets you to the top. Maybe you didn’t land the job yet, but last week, you:✅ Updated your LinkedIn profile✅ Sent out a few applications✅ Practiced answering tough interview questions✅ Made a new connection✅ Researched five companies you’d love to work for✅ Updated your resume to better showcase your value✅ Had a conversation with someone at a target companyThese steps matter. They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script. Instead of focusing on what didn’t happen, tell me—what’s one thing you accomplished last week that brought you closer to your goal?

Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later.

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

If you meet at least 70% of the qualifications, go ahead and apply! 🎯 Many talented individuals self-disqualify, thinking they need to be a 100% match. That's not the case! I can testify!💡 At Microsoft, our managers, recruiters and hiring committees are trained to focus on candidates who align closely with most of the job requirements, not all. 📚👀🛠️ As a seasoned IT professional who learned this the hard way early on in my IT career, I'm here to tell you—give yourself a chance! It might just be the break you need. 🌈 When I applied to Microsoft, I knew I didn't fully meet the job requirements.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

If you meet at least 70% of the qualifications, go ahead and apply! 🎯 Many talented individuals self-disqualify, thinking they need to be a 100% match. That's not the case! I can testify!💡 At Microsoft, our managers, recruiters and hiring committees are trained to focus on candidates who align closely with most of the job requirements, not all. 📚👀🛠️ As a seasoned IT professional who learned this the hard way early on in my IT career, I'm here to tell you—give yourself a chance! It might just be the break you need. 🌈 When I applied to Microsoft, I knew I didn't fully meet the job requirements. However, they saw potential in me, appreciated my unique skills, and the value I could add to the culture.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Carrie BrysonCarrie Bryson,,"🎯 Progress, Not Perfection! 🎯Job searching can feel like a rollercoaster—some days you’re riding high, and other days, it feels like you’re stuck at the bottom. But here’s the secret: progress is what gets you to the top. Maybe you didn’t land the job yet, but last week, you:✅ Updated your LinkedIn profile✅ Sent out a few applications✅ Practiced answering tough interview questions✅ Made a new connection✅ Researched five companies you’d love to work for✅ Updated your resume to better showcase your value✅ Had a conversation with someone at a target companyThese steps matter. They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script. Instead of focusing on what didn’t happen, tell me—what’s one thing you accomplished last week that brought you closer to your goal?

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health. A daily workout has really helped me feel better, both mentally and physically, and I’ll need those well-fitting work pants soon!Im attaching my updated resume with on this platform for reac.

There's a delicate balance when delivering a component like this to the engineering team. Each node had to be carefully weighted. What you don't see in this shot is that the timeline is divided into three equal parts. I accounted for future iterations by testing different character counts on headings, that was just one of the many many things I needed to account for. Again, lots more to discuss, reach out for more. **Interesting early results: Weekend posts are underperforming in terms of views.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later.

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number.

Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health. A daily workout has really helped me feel better, both mentally and physically, and I’ll need those well-fitting work pants soon!Im attaching my updated resume with on this platform for reac.

There's a delicate balance when delivering a component like this to the engineering team. Each node had to be carefully weighted. What you don't see in this shot is that the timeline is divided into three equal parts. I accounted for future iterations by testing different character counts on headings, that was just one of the many many things I needed to account for.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later. That’s just one of the ways to refocus your mind and promote yourself. Learn the rest in the blog. https://lnkd.in/grf_dk2R

Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs

Carrie BrysonCarrie Bryson,,"🎯 Progress, Not Perfection! 🎯Job searching can feel like a rollercoaster—some days you’re riding high, and other days, it feels like you’re stuck at the bottom. But here’s the secret: progress is what gets you to the top. Maybe you didn’t land the job yet, but last week, you:✅ Updated your LinkedIn profile✅ Sent out a few applications✅ Practiced answering tough interview questions✅ Made a new connection✅ Researched five companies you’d love to work for✅ Updated your resume to better showcase your value✅ Had a conversation with someone at a target companyThese steps matter. They moved you forward, even if they didn’t feel big enough to celebrate. The job search isn’t about being perfect—it’s about consistently showing up for yourself.So, let’s flip the script.

Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Max HunterMax Hunter,,"""But Senator Curtis raises an important question: Elon Musk really shows us that being a billionaire means you can treat people like they're just an afterthought—who needs empathy when you have rockets, right?"" Why is it acceptable for powerful and wealthy leaders like Elon to treat employees as mere numbers, while concerns about federal employees spark national debates?This moment in history underscores the fragile nature of our relationships with the labor market. Many individuals are quietly terminated (deleted) across various sectors, including healthcare and education, serving as a daily reminder that job security is as solid as a house of cards—one gust of wind and poof!Instead of viewing government employees as deserving of special treatment, we should recognize the broader systemic issues affecting all workers on personal and structural levels. It’s also crucial to remember that some industry leaders promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives but fail to uphold these values in practice, as seen in the case of Ben Danielson.This farce creates a bewildering cognitive dissonance. Meanwhile, it feels like a swarm of mini-Elons (some in drag) are running around in administration and management, wielding power in a way that reveals a disregard for the humanity of their employees—treating them as mere data points while masking their true pathological motivations behind a façade of corporate jargon and bottom-line excuses.Ultimately, this reflects a larger zeitgeist, highlighting the urgent need for a cultural shift in how we value and support all workers. It’s time to foster a society that genuinely prioritizes empathy and respect, rather than treating them as mere buzzwords.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

I feel for everyone affected by recent layoffs, as I know what that feels like myself. If you find yourself in this situation, my advice is to take a moment for yourself. Use this time to relax and rethink what you want in your career and in life. Give yourself a few days to process everything. Go to the gym, talk about your options and your process with family and friends so they can support you on this new journey. Don’t hesitate to feel whatever emotions come up—whether it’s laughter or tears. Spend some time focusing on what you love outside of work, even if it's just for a little while. Remember, you’re not failing; you’re “failing forward.” This time can actually be valuable as you prepare for the next great opportunity that comes your way. Fellow job seekers, we have what the world needs, and it will come! Keep praying, meditating, and staying strong for your mental health.

"Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)Kelly Hirn, (Experienced Leadership Talent Developer)",,"The first time the job I desperately wanted went to Lisa, I was crushed. I had more experience, a stronger leadership focus, and better rapport with the team she would now get the chance to manage. A bunch of well meaning friends said she stole the job and the leadership team was trying to hold me back. I’ll be honest, I think some of what they said might have been true. But focusing on that would have killed my chances at the next opportunity and the next one. I am beyond thankful for the mentor who taught me where to put my focus instead. My first step was building connections and yours may be too. You can build relationships in every single meeting. Meaning you could go into a statics meeting with a manager from another department, focus on making the data digestible for him and his team, and be offered a job teaching data analysts a few months later.

Angela HolbrookAngela Holbrook,,"👋 Happy Monday LinkedIn! I know it’s not valentines but this recent video I took still makes me smile! I hope it makes YOU smile. 🙂 I haven’t been posting as much but we do have positions, primarily in food manufacturing, operations leadership, and maintenance. Please comment or shoot me a message if you want more info! 😬 Even though social media is a big part of recruitment networking, social media in general can also be draining. I loathe seeing all the bickering and arguing. I’ve found myself cringing more as I log onto LinkedIn.2025 I’ve been more intentional about unplugging and having meaningful connections in community! It’s been AMAZING. 🤩 🤔 With 22+ years recruiting experience I feel a noticeable shift happened ~ March 2024. The talent/skills I used to tap for opportunities, were tapping me, at an increasing rate. Lot of layoffs and company closings in 2024 that seemed to be largely ignored - maybe b/c it was an election year? AI effect? Who knows. 😀 We are still looking for talent in the aforementioned areas. I still see Accounting remaining in high demand! And blue-collar jobs (e.g. trades) and leaders that stay at jobs more than 2 years, as companies and teams seem to want STABILITY.Not sure how many of you are feeling about social media these days – 🧐👉 I suppose this is a long winded way to share YES still hiring BUT not as active/fast to respond on LinkedIn. We CAN still be efficient/effective without living on social media platforms constantly. Lastly, if you are looking, friendly reminder to upload your most current resume on job boards (like Indeed) or industry specific job sites (like Careers in Food).I just typed in the word “the” for jobs and “United States” on indeed and as of today 2.24.25 there are supposedly 4,637,000+ jobs available. But - I do recommend sniper rifle vs shotgun approach. Target 🎯 companies and locations that truly interest you. I mention Indeed bc frankly they still dominate market share when it comes to open jobs. ✌️ hashtag#hiring hashtag#manufacturing hashtag#layoffs hashtag#jobsearchtips hashtag#food hashtag#operations hashtag#Boisejobs
