Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce.

Bernie TiddBernie Tidd,,"The Epoch Times ◼️ US ◼️ Regional & State News ◼️ State News ◼️ Ohio News Vivek Ramaswamy Announces Candidacy for Ohio Governor****************************************************************The Ohio-born biotech entrepreneur, who still lives in the state, launched his bid a month after leaving DOGE.****************************************************************By Jeff Louderback2/24/2025; Updated: 2/24/2025CINCINNATI—Vivek Ramaswamy, the Cincinnati-born biotech entrepreneur who ran for president last year before leaving the race and supporting President Donald Trump, has launched a bid for Ohio governor.His announcement on Feb. 24 had been anticipated for several weeks since the 39-year-old Ramaswamy left his role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on the first day of Trump’s new term.The Ohio native, who now lives in suburban Columbus, kicked off his candidacy at CTL Aerospace amid a crowd holding “Vivek for Ohio” signs. Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking. We’ve lost so many spaces and have gotten away from connecting with each other in real life. I think the station’s ability to do that is really important.”Read the full article by Jas Keimig today at South Seattle Emerald. https://lnkd.in/gQFPpkwE ///hashtag#SouthSeattleEmerald hashtag#Seattle hashtag#SouthSeattle hashtag#SouthEnd hashtag#KVRU

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

This stuff makes a real difference.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

South Seattle EmeraldSouth Seattle Emerald,,"South Seattle radio station KVRU 105.7 FM has a new owner and operator: Media for Informed Communities, headed by Crystal Fincher and Monisha Harrell. Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking. We’ve lost so many spaces and have gotten away from connecting with each other in real life. I think the station’s ability to do that is really important.”Read the full article by Jas Keimig today at South Seattle Emerald. https://lnkd.in/gQFPpkwE ///hashtag#SouthSeattleEmerald hashtag#Seattle hashtag#SouthSeattle hashtag#SouthEnd hashtag#KVRU

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Bernie TiddBernie Tidd,,"The Epoch Times ◼️ US ◼️ Regional & State News ◼️ State News ◼️ Ohio News Vivek Ramaswamy Announces Candidacy for Ohio Governor****************************************************************The Ohio-born biotech entrepreneur, who still lives in the state, launched his bid a month after leaving DOGE.****************************************************************By Jeff Louderback2/24/2025; Updated: 2/24/2025CINCINNATI—Vivek Ramaswamy, the Cincinnati-born biotech entrepreneur who ran for president last year before leaving the race and supporting President Donald Trump, has launched a bid for Ohio governor.His announcement on Feb. 24 had been anticipated for several weeks since the 39-year-old Ramaswamy left his role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on the first day of Trump’s new term.The Ohio native, who now lives in suburban Columbus, kicked off his candidacy at CTL Aerospace amid a crowd holding “Vivek for Ohio” signs. Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.Born to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.He first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”During his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”Ramaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted some of the wealthiest cities in the country because of industry.He said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”Ramaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.Ramaswamy also said that he will drive down property taxes.“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.*****Ramaswamy joins a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.*****In social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor. Ohio Republicans State Treasurer Robert Sprague and Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy.Jack Phillips contributed to this report.Jeff LouderbackReporterJeff Louderback covers news and features on the White House and executive agencies for The Epoch Times.

Chris W.Chris W.,,"TEXAS RESIDENTS - Please REPOST and take five minutes for an important follow up to my previous message regarding how you can help increase pay for Direct Service Providers working with, among others, children and adults with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities): The House subcommittee is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday OF THIS WEEK to consider testimony about the need for increased wages for our direct care staff. You can provide online support through the legislative portal at the following link: https://lnkd.in/gn-nswsZSHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR COMMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY WEDNESDAY FEB. 26th.INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking the link above, you will first have to verify you are a Texas resident and fill in your name, address and phone number. Next, scroll to the section labeled ""Appropriations - S/C on Article II February 26, 2025 - 8:00 AM [E1.030]"" and then to the subtitle labeled ""Article II Special Provisions"".  Click SELECT.  Then you can enter your message.  If you choose, a sample message you can cut and paste is below.  After that click submit.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help!!SAMPLE MESSAGE: The State Supported Living Centers and the State Hospitals experienced severe manpower shortages and turnover. On January 24, 2023 the Texas Health & Human Service Commission announced an increase in Direct Support Professionals (DSP) starting wages to $17.50 per hour as authorized by the 88th Legislature in Article II, Rider 95. In its August 2024 Report required by Rider 95, Health Human Services reported to the Legislature that as a result of the compensation change, filled positions have increased dramatically from 15,460 in February 2022 to 18,331 in April 2024 and turnover has declined from 40.70% to 25.84% in the same timeframe. DSP Filled Positions have increased from 3,964 in September 2022 to 5,006 in May 2024, an increase of 26.30% Private Provider DSP’s have the same task responsibilities as the SSLC and SH DSP’s. Funding DSP pay at the same level will increase filled positions, reduce turnover, and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, dramatically improve quality of care and client outcomes. I encourage you to provide for a starting wage of $17.50 per hour to properly compensate those who care for the Special Needs Population and restore the unfilled positions in our DSP Workforce. It will not only improve the quality of care but have a positive economic impact on our DSPs and our State Economy.

Fincher and Harrell are taking the reins from Seattle arts organization Southeast Effective Development (SEED) and SEEDArts. A low-power radio station dedicated to local music, culture, politics, and sports, KVRU also hosted community workshops and media classes. “We see ourselves as a part of this community and a hub for connection,” said Fincher, a former KVRU programmer. “I think connection is something we are sorely lacking.

Comox Valley Regional DistrictComox Valley Regional District,,"CVRD News: Unified Alternative Approval Process Results AnnouncedThe Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) Unified Alternative Approval Process (AAP) has completed and results have been finalized. The deadline for responses was February 18, 2025 at 4:30pm.Less than 10% of the eligible electors signed and submitted elector response forms by the deadline for all four CVRD initiatives.In line with provincial legislation, the Corporate Officer has reviewed and certified the results. Elector response forms must be rejected when:- an elector signed more than one form (duplicates);- an elector is determined to be ineligible;- more than one non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to the same property; or - a non-resident property elector signed a form in relation to a property owned in whole or in part by a corporation.In this instance, the vast majority of rejected elector response forms were either due to duplicate forms submitted or ineligibility, as residents were outside of the defined service area.These results and the associated bylaws will be considered by the CVRD Board at their February 25, 2025 regular meeting.Full news release: https://ow.ly/7HrW50V5NXZFor more information on the AAP and to learn more about voter requirements for each initiative, visit www.comoxvalleyrd.ca/aap.

Reymon CagasReymon Cagas,,"QUESTION: What do you understand about the challenges faced by multi-barriered individuals in accessing employment?📣ANSWER: Multi-barriered individuals face numerous challenges that can hinder their ability to access and maintain stable employment. These barriers often intersect, making it even more difficult for these individuals to succeed in the Canadian labour market.Key Challenges Faced by Multi-Barriered Job Seekers1. Personal Barriers☑️Lack of Access to Education, No Training, & Skill Gaps – Limited formal education or outdated skills or a lack of specialized training can make job searches difficult and making them less competitive in the job market.☑️Lack of Work Experience – Gaps in employment history, lack of Canadian experience (for newcomers), or never having held a job before.☑️Mental & Physical Health Challenges – Anxiety, depression, disabilities, or chronic health conditions affecting work capacity.☑️Low Self-Esteem & Motivation – A history of rejection, discrimination, or personal struggles can lead to self-doubt and fear of failure.2. Systemic Barriers☑️Discrimination & Bias – Ageism, racism, ableism, and gender bias in hiring processes.☑️Lack of Employer Willingness to Accommodate – Some employers may hesitate to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities or unique needs.☑️Criminal Records – Past legal issues may limit access to certain industries or jobs requiring background checks.3. Socio-Economic Barriers☑️Poverty & Financial Constraints – Inability to afford transportation, work attire, childcare, or technology needed for job searching. Financial insecurity can prevent individuals from affording necessary certifications, training, or transportation costs to pursue employment opportunities.☑️Unstable Housing or Homelessness – Difficulty maintaining a job while dealing with housing instability.☑️Limited Social Support Networks – Lack of family or mentor support to provide career guidance and encouragement.🔑Addressing These Challenges:As an Employment Developer, it is important to provide personalized support, including skills development, resume-building, interview coaching, and job retention planning. Collaborating with employers to create inclusive and accommodating workplaces is essential to helping these individuals succeed. Identifying and removing specific barriers—whether through financial support, access to training, or connections to resources—can make a significant difference in improving their employment outcomes to achieve sustainable career success.
