Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this?

However, your next salary increment will likely be based on your current pay. So, negotiate well—don’t settle for less!✅ Recruitment ProcessUnlike many Western markets, most companies here don’t use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). Instead, recruiters manually review 8-10 resumes daily, meaning quality matters more than quantity.✅ Maximize Your Visibility •	Follow all major recruitment agencies and connect with recruiters in your field. •	Set up job alerts on their platforms. •	Email recruiters directly with a strong, well-crafted CV.Your job search isn’t just about applying—it’s about standing out!hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiddleEastJobs hashtag#DubaiJobs hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SalaryNegotiation hashtag#RecruitmentTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#RiyadhJobs

This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this?

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

ANNA SARTORANNA SARTOR,,"As of now, in general free zones companies cannot operate in mainland area.However, recently a reform has been introduced under the Executive Council Resolution No. (11) of 2025 Concerning the Regulation of Practice of Activities by Free Zone Establishments within the Emirate of Dubai with the aim to allow free zone companies or establishment (the “Establishment”) to operate in Mainland in the Emirate of Dubai (the “Emirate”).The provisions of this Resolution apply to Establishments that intend to conduct their activities beyond the Free Zone, excluding financial establishments licensed to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre.An Establishment may conduct its activities outside the Free Zone and within the Emirate, provided it obtains the permit by the Department of Economy and Tourism of Dubai (the “Department”) and through for example a license for establishing a branch within the Emirate or a permit to conduct certain activities within the Emirate.In order for the Department to grant a license for setting up a branch for the Establishment in the Emirate or to grant a permit, certain conditions shall be met, including for example:- the Establishment must submit an application to the Department as per the relevant approved forms, procedures, and mechanisms for establishing a branch or obtaining the permit for the intended activity;- prior approval of Licensing Authority (the Authority of the Free Zone that granted the license to the Establishment) is mandatory;- the approval of any relevant government authorities overseeing the activity to be conducted outside the Free Zone and within the Emirate is mandatory;- certain documents such as copy of the articles of incorporation and of the license of the Establishment shall be submitted.To be noted that:- the activity to be conducted within the Emirate must be included in the list of activities that the Department will issue;- license for branches will have a validity of one year and can be renewed, while permit will be granted for a period not exceeding six (6) months;- the Establishment's branch shall not have a legal personality and shall not be regarded as independent from the parent Establishment.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Yassine ChafrarYassine Chafrar,,"Leggere di un investimento così imponente nell’AI, come questo negli UAE, un paese che per decenni ha dimostrato che vige concretezza nella loro visione, non è solo il forte segnale che il futuro è già qui, è l’invito a ripensare al nostro modo di lavorare e vivere in un mondo che cambia ad un ritmo che anni fa sembrava inimmaginabile.E quel “anni fa” sta sempre più diventando un “mesi fa”, perché i cambiamenti drastici stanno sempre più avvenendo nel giro di mesi, non anni. L’AI ci sta chiaramente guardando in viso, e porgendo una mano. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti saluta, perché può prendere il tuo posto. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti supporta, perché un integratore al tuo potenziale.Si sono aperte e si stanno aprendo nuove sfide, nuove opportunità di crescita e trasformazione. La vera sfida qua, è farci trovare pronti, con mente aperta, visione e determinazione, per trasformare ogni cambiamento in un trampolino verso il futuro. Ed anche se un giorno un robot dovesse portarci il caffè senza muovere un dito, saremo, e dovremo, essere sempre noi a deciderne gusto, intensità, e concezione.E tu in ciò, che sfida stai affrontando?hashtag#AI hashtag#UAE hashtag#Innovazione hashtag#Investimenti hashtag#Crescita

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Yassine ChafrarYassine Chafrar,,"Leggere di un investimento così imponente nell’AI, come questo negli UAE, un paese che per decenni ha dimostrato che vige concretezza nella loro visione, non è solo il forte segnale che il futuro è già qui, è l’invito a ripensare al nostro modo di lavorare e vivere in un mondo che cambia ad un ritmo che anni fa sembrava inimmaginabile.E quel “anni fa” sta sempre più diventando un “mesi fa”, perché i cambiamenti drastici stanno sempre più avvenendo nel giro di mesi, non anni. L’AI ci sta chiaramente guardando in viso, e porgendo una mano. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti saluta, perché può prendere il tuo posto. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti supporta, perché un integratore al tuo potenziale.Si sono aperte e si stanno aprendo nuove sfide, nuove opportunità di crescita e trasformazione. La vera sfida qua, è farci trovare pronti, con mente aperta, visione e determinazione, per trasformare ogni cambiamento in un trampolino verso il futuro. Ed anche se un giorno un robot dovesse portarci il caffè senza muovere un dito, saremo, e dovremo, essere sempre noi a deciderne gusto, intensità, e concezione.E tu in ciò, che sfida stai affrontando?hashtag#AI hashtag#UAE hashtag#Innovazione hashtag#Investimenti hashtag#Crescita

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

However, your next salary increment will likely be based on your current pay. So, negotiate well—don’t settle for less!✅ Recruitment ProcessUnlike many Western markets, most companies here don’t use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). Instead, recruiters manually review 8-10 resumes daily, meaning quality matters more than quantity.✅ Maximize Your Visibility •	Follow all major recruitment agencies and connect with recruiters in your field. •	Set up job alerts on their platforms. •	Email recruiters directly with a strong, well-crafted CV.Your job search isn’t just about applying—it’s about standing out!hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiddleEastJobs hashtag#DubaiJobs hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SalaryNegotiation hashtag#RecruitmentTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#RiyadhJobs

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Yassine ChafrarYassine Chafrar,,"Leggere di un investimento così imponente nell’AI, come questo negli UAE, un paese che per decenni ha dimostrato che vige concretezza nella loro visione, non è solo il forte segnale che il futuro è già qui, è l’invito a ripensare al nostro modo di lavorare e vivere in un mondo che cambia ad un ritmo che anni fa sembrava inimmaginabile.E quel “anni fa” sta sempre più diventando un “mesi fa”, perché i cambiamenti drastici stanno sempre più avvenendo nel giro di mesi, non anni. L’AI ci sta chiaramente guardando in viso, e porgendo una mano. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti saluta, perché può prendere il tuo posto. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti supporta, perché un integratore al tuo potenziale.Si sono aperte e si stanno aprendo nuove sfide, nuove opportunità di crescita e trasformazione. La vera sfida qua, è farci trovare pronti, con mente aperta, visione e determinazione, per trasformare ogni cambiamento in un trampolino verso il futuro.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

However, your next salary increment will likely be based on your current pay. So, negotiate well—don’t settle for less!✅ Recruitment ProcessUnlike many Western markets, most companies here don’t use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). Instead, recruiters manually review 8-10 resumes daily, meaning quality matters more than quantity.✅ Maximize Your Visibility •	Follow all major recruitment agencies and connect with recruiters in your field. •	Set up job alerts on their platforms. •	Email recruiters directly with a strong, well-crafted CV.Your job search isn’t just about applying—it’s about standing out!hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiddleEastJobs hashtag#DubaiJobs hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SalaryNegotiation hashtag#RecruitmentTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#RiyadhJobs

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Two of the most disliked professions I reckon, if I were to run a poll (which I haven't) 😬.Like all jobs, there are those who are fantastic representatives of the profession and others who let the side down.

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Two of the most disliked professions I reckon, if I were to run a poll (which I haven't) 😬.Like all jobs, there are those who are fantastic representatives of the profession and others who let the side down.  We are ""people"" businesses.  We manage human beings on both sides of a process and that's a tough gig that not all can make a success of.So I wanted to take a moment to shout out to my fantastic team at Central Employment.

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Abu Dhabi offers a unique lifestyle on a global level, and certainly the demand was high for the first reason, which is that it is ranked first among the safest cities in the world, and this is the most important thing for anyone who wants to live, invest, or start a business. The fertile environment provides all the needs of different segments of society in the best way, and it is still considered one of the cities that impose the lowest taxes despite the excellent services provided by the city of Abu Dhabi. Compared to other countries whose safety rankings are in the 30th level and above, and yet the residents of these countries still suffer from a tax of up to 50%, Abu Dhabi has always been and will always be a nurturing and fertile environment for entrepreneurship.كم اعتدنا على رؤية ابو ظبي للمستقبل تعد ابو ظبي ليس فقط مدينة الاثرياء بل هية البيئة الخصبة لي أي رائد اعمال او مستثمر او حتى من يبحث عن سكن . تقدم ابو ظبي نظام حياة مميز على المستوى العالمي وبل تاكيد الاقبال كان كبيرا لسبب الاول وهوى انها المدينة في المرتبة الأولى الأكثر امان في العالم وهوى يعد الشيء الأكثر اهمية لي اي شخص يريد العيش او الاستثمار او بدء ريادة اعماله. البيئة الخصبة التي توفر جميع احتياجات مختلف طبقات المجتمع على افضل نحو والتي ما زالت تعد واحد من اقل المدن التي تفرض اقل ضريبة على مستوى الخدمات الممتازة التي تقدمها مدينة ابو ظبي . مقارنة بي دول اخرى التي يعد ترتيبها في الامان في المستويات ال 30 وما فوق ومع زالك يعاني سكان هذه الدول من ضريبة تصل الى 50 % لذلك تعد ابو ظبي دائما وابدا البيئة الحاضنة والخصبة لريادة الاعمال hashtag#Capital_management hashtag#real_estate hashtag#property hashtag#investor hashtag#home hashtag#news hashtag#Entrepreneurs hashtag#safety hashtag#Wealth_Managementhashtag#property_managementhashtag#abu_dhabihashtag#dubai

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

However, your next salary increment will likely be based on your current pay. So, negotiate well—don’t settle for less!✅ Recruitment ProcessUnlike many Western markets, most companies here don’t use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). Instead, recruiters manually review 8-10 resumes daily, meaning quality matters more than quantity.✅ Maximize Your Visibility •	Follow all major recruitment agencies and connect with recruiters in your field. •	Set up job alerts on their platforms. •	Email recruiters directly with a strong, well-crafted CV.Your job search isn’t just about applying—it’s about standing out!hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiddleEastJobs hashtag#DubaiJobs hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SalaryNegotiation hashtag#RecruitmentTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#RiyadhJobs

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Abu Dhabi offers a unique lifestyle on a global level, and certainly the demand was high for the first reason, which is that it is ranked first among the safest cities in the world, and this is the most important thing for anyone who wants to live, invest, or start a business.

Compared to other countries whose safety rankings are in the 30th level and above, and yet the residents of these countries still suffer from a tax of up to 50%, Abu Dhabi has always been and will always be a nurturing and fertile environment for entrepreneurship.كم اعتدنا على رؤية ابو ظبي للمستقبل تعد ابو ظبي ليس فقط مدينة الاثرياء بل هية البيئة الخصبة لي أي رائد اعمال او مستثمر او حتى من يبحث عن سكن . تقدم ابو ظبي نظام حياة مميز على المستوى العالمي وبل تاكيد الاقبال كان كبيرا لسبب الاول وهوى انها المدينة في المرتبة الأولى الأكثر امان في العالم وهوى يعد الشيء الأكثر اهمية لي اي شخص يريد العيش او الاستثمار او بدء ريادة اعماله. البيئة الخصبة التي توفر جميع احتياجات مختلف طبقات المجتمع على افضل نحو والتي ما زالت تعد واحد من اقل المدن التي تفرض اقل ضريبة على مستوى الخدمات الممتازة التي تقدمها مدينة ابو ظبي . مقارنة بي دول اخرى التي يعد ترتيبها في الامان في المستويات ال 30 وما فوق ومع زالك يعاني سكان هذه الدول من ضريبة تصل الى 50 % لذلك تعد ابو ظبي دائما وابدا البيئة الحاضنة والخصبة لريادة الاعمال hashtag#Capital_management hashtag#real_estate hashtag#property hashtag#investor hashtag#home hashtag#news hashtag#Entrepreneurs hashtag#safety hashtag#Wealth_Managementhashtag#property_managementhashtag#abu_dhabihashtag#dubai

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

MOUSA MOHAMADMOUSA MOHAMAD,,"As we are accustomed to seeing Abu Dhabi for the future, Abu Dhabi is not only the city of the rich, but it is a fertile environment for any entrepreneur, investor, or even someone looking for a residence. Abu Dhabi offers a unique lifestyle on a global level, and certainly the demand was high for the first reason, which is that it is ranked first among the safest cities in the world, and this is the most important thing for anyone who wants to live, invest, or start a business. The fertile environment provides all the needs of different segments of society in the best way, and it is still considered one of the cities that impose the lowest taxes despite the excellent services provided by the city of Abu Dhabi. Compared to other countries whose safety rankings are in the 30th level and above, and yet the residents of these countries still suffer from a tax of up to 50%, Abu Dhabi has always been and will always be a nurturing and fertile environment for entrepreneurship.كم اعتدنا على رؤية ابو ظبي للمستقبل تعد ابو ظبي ليس فقط مدينة الاثرياء بل هية البيئة الخصبة لي أي رائد اعمال او مستثمر او حتى من يبحث عن سكن . تقدم ابو ظبي نظام حياة مميز على المستوى العالمي وبل تاكيد الاقبال كان كبيرا لسبب الاول وهوى انها المدينة في المرتبة الأولى الأكثر امان في العالم وهوى يعد الشيء الأكثر اهمية لي اي شخص يريد العيش او الاستثمار او بدء ريادة اعماله. البيئة الخصبة التي توفر جميع احتياجات مختلف طبقات المجتمع على افضل نحو والتي ما زالت تعد واحد من اقل المدن التي تفرض اقل ضريبة على مستوى الخدمات الممتازة التي تقدمها مدينة ابو ظبي . مقارنة بي دول اخرى التي يعد ترتيبها في الامان في المستويات ال 30 وما فوق ومع زالك يعاني سكان هذه الدول من ضريبة تصل الى 50 % لذلك تعد ابو ظبي دائما وابدا البيئة الحاضنة والخصبة لريادة الاعمال hashtag#Capital_management hashtag#real_estate hashtag#property hashtag#investor hashtag#home hashtag#news hashtag#Entrepreneurs hashtag#safety hashtag#Wealth_Managementhashtag#property_managementhashtag#abu_dhabihashtag#dubai

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Yassine ChafrarYassine Chafrar,,"Leggere di un investimento così imponente nell’AI, come questo negli UAE, un paese che per decenni ha dimostrato che vige concretezza nella loro visione, non è solo il forte segnale che il futuro è già qui, è l’invito a ripensare al nostro modo di lavorare e vivere in un mondo che cambia ad un ritmo che anni fa sembrava inimmaginabile.E quel “anni fa” sta sempre più diventando un “mesi fa”, perché i cambiamenti drastici stanno sempre più avvenendo nel giro di mesi, non anni. L’AI ci sta chiaramente guardando in viso, e porgendo una mano. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti saluta, perché può prendere il tuo posto. Una mano che ti stringe, e poi ti supporta, perché un integratore al tuo potenziale.Si sono aperte e si stanno aprendo nuove sfide, nuove opportunità di crescita e trasformazione. La vera sfida qua, è farci trovare pronti, con mente aperta, visione e determinazione, per trasformare ogni cambiamento in un trampolino verso il futuro. Ed anche se un giorno un robot dovesse portarci il caffè senza muovere un dito, saremo, e dovremo, essere sempre noi a deciderne gusto, intensità, e concezione.E tu in ciò, che sfida stai affrontando?hashtag#AI hashtag#UAE hashtag#Innovazione hashtag#Investimenti hashtag#Crescita

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

MOUSA MOHAMADMOUSA MOHAMAD,,"As we are accustomed to seeing Abu Dhabi for the future, Abu Dhabi is not only the city of the rich, but it is a fertile environment for any entrepreneur, investor, or even someone looking for a residence. Abu Dhabi offers a unique lifestyle on a global level, and certainly the demand was high for the first reason, which is that it is ranked first among the safest cities in the world, and this is the most important thing for anyone who wants to live, invest, or start a business. The fertile environment provides all the needs of different segments of society in the best way, and it is still considered one of the cities that impose the lowest taxes despite the excellent services provided by the city of Abu Dhabi. Compared to other countries whose safety rankings are in the 30th level and above, and yet the residents of these countries still suffer from a tax of up to 50%, Abu Dhabi has always been and will always be a nurturing and fertile environment for entrepreneurship.كم اعتدنا على رؤية ابو ظبي للمستقبل تعد ابو ظبي ليس فقط مدينة الاثرياء بل هية البيئة الخصبة لي أي رائد اعمال او مستثمر او حتى من يبحث عن سكن . تقدم ابو ظبي نظام حياة مميز على المستوى العالمي وبل تاكيد الاقبال كان كبيرا لسبب الاول وهوى انها المدينة في المرتبة الأولى الأكثر امان في العالم وهوى يعد الشيء الأكثر اهمية لي اي شخص يريد العيش او الاستثمار او بدء ريادة اعماله. البيئة الخصبة التي توفر جميع احتياجات مختلف طبقات المجتمع على افضل نحو والتي ما زالت تعد واحد من اقل المدن التي تفرض اقل ضريبة على مستوى الخدمات الممتازة التي تقدمها مدينة ابو ظبي . مقارنة بي دول اخرى التي يعد ترتيبها في الامان في المستويات ال 30 وما فوق ومع زالك يعاني سكان هذه الدول من ضريبة تصل الى 50 % لذلك تعد ابو ظبي دائما وابدا البيئة الحاضنة والخصبة لريادة الاعمال hashtag#Capital_management hashtag#real_estate hashtag#property hashtag#investor hashtag#home hashtag#news hashtag#Entrepreneurs hashtag#safety hashtag#Wealth_Managementhashtag#property_managementhashtag#abu_dhabihashtag#dubai

Prasad SawantPrasad Sawant,,"How often do we chase things in life—recognition, wealth, status, and material success—thinking they’ll bring us happiness? We set goals, climb ladders, and push forward, believing that once we reach there, we’ll finally be happy. But what if happiness isn’t at the finish line? What if it’s a conscious choice we make every day?Last evening, as I sat at Dubai Opera, watching Max Amini perform, I looked around and saw people from all walks of life—different cultures, backgrounds, and stories—coming together for one thing: laughter. No barriers, no labels, just pure joy. And in that moment, I realized once again that experiences like these, the ones we actively choose to immerse ourselves in, are what truly add meaning to life.That’s the beauty of Dubai—it’s not just a city of skyscrapers and luxury; it’s a place where people come to build their dreams and experience life. Finding that balance between ambition and joy, between success and moments that feed the soul, is what makes life truly fulfilling.Whether it’s investing in a home, a lifestyle, or experiences that bring you happiness, Dubai offers it all. And for me, moments like last night reaffirm that happiness isn’t something to wait for—it’s something to create.hashtag#LifeInDubai hashtag#HappinessIsAChoice hashtag#DubaiExperiences hashtag#DubaiOpera hashtag#MaxAmini hashtag#FindingBalance hashtag#Realtordubai

Agnes BriggsAgnes Briggs,,"The I’ve come across numerous complaints on social media about real estate agents in Abu Dhabi—ranging from unresponsiveness and lack of professionalism to outright scams. Unfortunately, these negative experiences can make the property search stressful for expats and investors. To help you navigate the market with confidence, I’m sharing essential tips on how to find a legitimate and reliable real estate agent in Abu Dhabi. Finding the right property in Abu Dhabi starts with finding the right agent. But how do you ensure you’re working with a legitimate and trustworthy real estate broker? Here are some key tips:✅ Check Their License – Every broker in Abu Dhabi must be licensed by the Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT). Ask for their broker card or verify their registration with their agency.✅ Use Verified Platforms Like Property Finder – Platforms such as Property Finder UAE list verified agents and agencies, making it easier to connect with licensed professionals. Always check the agent’s profile and credentials before engaging.✅ Research Their Reputation – Read online reviews, ask for referrals from other expats, and check their past client experiences. A reputable agent should have a solid track record.✅ Work with Established Agencies – Choose brokers from well-known, reputable real estate firms that comply with Abu Dhabi’s real estate regulations. This reduces the risk of dealing with unlicensed or unreliable agents.🚨 Red Flags to Avoid:❌ Agents who pressure you into making quick decisions❌ Deals that seem too good to be true❌ Requests for cash payments without official receipts or contracts❌ Lack of transparency on fees, terms, and market conditionsA legitimate and knowledgeable broker will guide you through the process with transparency and professionalism, ensuring a smooth and secure property transaction.Respect Goes Both Ways: The Client’s Role in a Successful Property SearchFinding the right home or investment isn’t just about choosing the right agent—it’s also about how you, as a client, engage in the process. Many buyers and tenants unknowingly make the mistake of working with multiple agents at once, or even calling the landlord’s office, thinking it will speed things up. But here’s the truth: a good agent can sense when they’re just one of many, and that lack of exclusivity often leads to a lack of commitment.Real estate agents dedicate time, effort, and expertise to finding you the best options. When you spread your search across multiple agents, no one truly takes ownership of your needs. Instead, if you find a trustworthy, hardworking agent, respect their time, value their guidance, and allow them to do what they do best—find you the right home.Trust the process, and in return, you’ll get the commitment and results you deserve.What are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences.

Nikita Gicanda VerveldeNikita Gicanda Vervelde,,"🧡 Freelance Exchange taught me a lot. Here's the honest part.Over the last 10 years, I’ve worked as both a freelancer and someone hiring freelancers — especially from equity-deserving communities. And while I love freelancing (and freelancers), this dual perspective has shown me just how often our expectations miss each other.We built Freelance Exchange with Good Growth Hub to bridge this gap. 📎 You can read the full case study via Local Champions CIC (reshared below) — but today I want to be honest about the hard truths: the ones we often don’t say out loud — about working across power, pressure, and people’s real lives.My first freelance job was in 2014. Since then, I’ve built a six-figure consultancy career and run Local Champions CIC — a social enterprise and international consultancy working across the UK and Rwanda.I’ve also hired & managed over 30 freelancers in the last five years.Here’s the truth: it’s still one of the hardest things I do.Not because freelancers are difficult — but because the relationship between freelancers & employers, especially in small orgs like ours, is rarely discussed with the mutual understanding it deserves.What employers need to understand about freelancers:🫀 Life happens — family, mental health, burnout. I’ve missed deadlines too. What matters is honest communication. I’ve been lucky to work with partners like A New Direction who led with care, not punishment.⚖️ Many freelancers face systemic inequality. Equity is not charity. Building systems of access and support is justice.📚 Clear briefs unlock better work. Employers must scope well, pay on time, and model professionalism.💡 Invest early — and freelancers often over-deliver long-term.What freelancers need to understand about employers:💸 Budgeting for you matters — especially in small orgs. We hire instead of paying ourselves. If you want fair pay, remember: delivery and communication are part of that fairness.⏳ Missed deadlines cost more than time — they break trust. One late task can derail reports, delay programmes, or damage partnerships.📣 Communication isn’t optional — it’s part of the job. Up-managing is a superpower. The best freelancers check in, clarify, and flag risks early.🧠 Understanding how public/third sector employers work gives you an edge.📑 Deposits and contracts are valid — but so is delivery. You can’t expect full payment for half-complete work.The future of work needs both sides to do better.And we can — with honesty, shared values, and radical collaboration.🧡 Deep gratitude to every freelancer, partner, funder, and teammate who shaped this work. Let’s keep building better, together.✨ Freelancers deserve more than gigs. ✨ Employers deserve more than stress. 🧡 Together, we can build environments where both sides win.🔗 Case study @LocalChampionsCIC hashtag#FreelanceExchange hashtag#WeMakeChampions hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Freelancers hashtag#InclusiveInnovation hashtag#SystemsChange hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#LocalChampions

Timea K.Timea K.,,"𝕋𝕠𝕠 𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕪 𝔹𝕚𝕘 𝔽𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕀𝕟 𝔸 𝕊𝕞𝕒𝕝𝕝 ℙ𝕠𝕟𝕕? - hashtag#ENERGY analysis of SOME of Dubai's future prospects, from a critical thinking Energy GuideDisclaimer: My research is energy based and I explore many fascets, avenues to give a BALANCED viewpoint as a NEUTRAL observer. I wish to see EVERYONE WIN!2024 figures show 66.97m hashtag#UK residents - with ~4.55% of them millionaires. This figure is projected to decline to 3.62% by 2028. Factors contributing to this are changes in tax policies: abolition of the non-domiciled tax status, and a culture perceived as hostile to wealth creators - UK's transit chart is showing this clearly.Compare this to 3.82m hashtag#Dubai residents with ~72,5k millionaires, about 1.9%.​ The wealth of Dubai's royal family has an estimated net worth of $18bn. So we are talking big! A member on here wrote that one needs MINIMUM 10m nowadays to feel secure - but in Dubai? Even the underworld packs $1.5bn. So wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few - in a small pond.So I pulled up Dubai's chart. HE is MASCULINE 80% Yang, mutable 80% and fire dominant: basically a Sagittarius. Natally (1st pic) has Sagittarius Neptune, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury - in line with the welcoming, international melting pot of different cultures, stimulating environment, relaxed taxation image. Aries Neptune transit will further enhance this, but the Libra Pluto opposition (and other transits) will challenge it too. Sagittarius energy, while visionary, can also be dogmatic with rigid ideological structures that cover up deeper systemic issues. The “bigger is better” mindset can reveal cracks in the foundation of long-term stability. In progressed (2nd pic) the tension is between a strong T-sqare, and a fainter blue grand air trine - Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node (destiny) trine Libra Pluto Rx and Gemini Saturn Rx. Mars (action, drive) long progressed from spiritual warrior Pisces into hands-on, determined Aries warrior.I also see (3rd pic) a beautiful Pluto-Pluto trine on top of the Aquarius Sun, North Node combo: that is creating a national identity based on real Aquarian principles - coexisting in harmony and respecting differences. The road there will require a powerhouse of strategic intellect, sharp decision-making, and disruptive insight: the apex of the T-square is that Capricorn Mercury.For Dubai to achieve true Aquarian harmony, it must embrace radical transparency, decentralized power structures, and collective progress. With its progressed Aquarius Sun conjunct North Node and Pluto - trined by natal Libra Pluto - the city's destiny is to balance power with fairness, innovation with social responsibility. This alignment calls for equitable wealth distribution, futuristic governance, and a shift from exclusivity to inclusivity. By integrating cutting-edge technology with ethical reform, Dubai can emerge as a true beacon of progressive leadership in the new era.

Prasad SawantPrasad Sawant,,"How often do we chase things in life—recognition, wealth, status, and material success—thinking they’ll bring us happiness? We set goals, climb ladders, and push forward, believing that once we reach there, we’ll finally be happy. But what if happiness isn’t at the finish line? What if it’s a conscious choice we make every day?Last evening, as I sat at Dubai Opera, watching Max Amini perform, I looked around and saw people from all walks of life—different cultures, backgrounds, and stories—coming together for one thing: laughter. No barriers, no labels, just pure joy. And in that moment, I realized once again that experiences like these, the ones we actively choose to immerse ourselves in, are what truly add meaning to life.That’s the beauty of Dubai—it’s not just a city of skyscrapers and luxury; it’s a place where people come to build their dreams and experience life. Finding that balance between ambition and joy, between success and moments that feed the soul, is what makes life truly fulfilling.Whether it’s investing in a home, a lifestyle, or experiences that bring you happiness, Dubai offers it all. And for me, moments like last night reaffirm that happiness isn’t something to wait for—it’s something to create.hashtag#LifeInDubai hashtag#HappinessIsAChoice hashtag#DubaiExperiences hashtag#DubaiOpera hashtag#MaxAmini hashtag#FindingBalance hashtag#Realtordubai
