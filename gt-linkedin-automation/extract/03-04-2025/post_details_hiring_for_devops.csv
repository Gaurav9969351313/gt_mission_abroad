Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has. Always will.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechTalent hashtag#RecruitmentStrategy hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ExecutionFirst hashtag#STEPSMindset hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TimeToHire

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

Lee HammerLee Hammer,,"⏳ 44 days. That’s the average time it takes to hire a tech candidate today.I ran a poll asking hiring leaders what their biggest challenge is right now— 50% said “lengthy hiring cycles.”And they’re right to be frustrated.According to LinkedIn, tech hiring takes 44 days, compared to just 33 in other industries. If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Alisha J. HarperAlisha J. Harper,,"Bridging the Gap: Aligning Your Resume with Job RequirementsOne of the biggest challenges job seekers face is ensuring their resume clearly reflects the requirements of the role they’re applying for. Even experienced professionals can fall into the trap of having hidden gaps—not because they lack the skills, but because their resume doesn’t connect the dots for hiring managers.🔎 Common Gaps That Can Hurt Your Application: ❌ Industry-Specific Experience – Having healthcare experience doesn’t always mean you have direct exposure to provider data integration or claims processing. Tailor your resume to show exact experience in the niche area.❌ Technical Skills – Many roles now require familiarity with tools like Azure DevOps, MS Project, or SQL. If you have experience but haven’t listed it, you’re missing an opportunity to showcase your qualifications.❌ Project Scope & Impact – Saying you’ve “led projects” is great, but what kind of projects? Were they large-scale data integrations? System migrations? Give details that match the job’s expectations.❌ Regulatory & Compliance Knowledge – If a job mentions HIPAA, CMS, or other regulations, make sure your resume explicitly shows your experience working within those guidelines.✅ How to Fix It: 🔹 Mirror the job description – Use keywords from the posting that apply to your experience. 🔹 Be specific – Instead of “Managed healthcare operations,” say “Led a provider data integration project ensuring compliance with CMS and HIPAA.” 🔹 Highlight tools & technologies – Even if it wasn’t your main focus, mention exposure to data platforms, analytics tools, or automation systems. 🔹 Quantify your impact – Show how your work improved efficiency, compliance, or cost savings.Your resume isn’t just a list of jobs—it’s your personal marketing tool. The more tailored and strategic you are, the better your chances of landing the role.

Viacheslav RyabchikovViacheslav Ryabchikov,Slavaslava.career@outlook.com,"Hello everyone,I wanted to reach out to my network as I am actively looking for new opportunities in any field. In October of 2024, I made the decision to leave my job with the hope that a new chapter would begin quickly and that I had experience to fall back on. Soon after, I explored an international outsourcing business opportunity while actively applying for remote jobs. The business opportunity I was working on has currently stalled and is not my prime focus at the moment. The job market has proven to be more challenging than I expected, and I continue to receive automated rejections for multiple IT jobs for which I am qualified, including entry-level positions. If you are aware of any opportunities, know someone who is hiring, or could provide a reference within your firm, I would greatly appreciate the chance to briefly touch base. Please feel free to reach out or pass along any leads at any time, and share this post with anyone who might be able to help.I have experience in accounting, system administration (Windows, Linux), IT audit, and IT controls testing and compliance (SOX, SOC1, and SOC2, focusing on ERP Systems such as Oracle and SAP) at KPMG. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any junior DevOps roles, Cyber Threat Analyst roles, AML/KYC compliance analyst and financial analyst. I am CPA eligible and also planning to complete CISSP by June 2025.I am NOT seeking solely remote opportunities; I am open to any full-time (in person), freelance or contract roles and am able to relocate anywhere in North America, given an appropriate salary to justify the move. Can work 7 days per week and have no external obligations other than finding immediate employment. I am based in the NYC metro area but will consider discussing any opportunity. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to connect soon.

If you're hiring for DevOps, Cloud, or AI/ML? You're looking at 50+ days to fill a single role.Why? ❌ Too many interviews ❌ Slow decision-making ❌ Bottlenecks and broken processesGlassdoor says 69% of employers know their process is too slow.SHRM reports that every extra day increases the chance your best candidate walks.Here’s the hard truth: Speed = survival in today’s talent market. If you're not moving fast, you’re losing fast.This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about tightening your process, building trust early, and moving with urgency.Execution wins. Always has.

Alisha J. HarperAlisha J. Harper,,"Bridging the Gap: Aligning Your Resume with Job RequirementsOne of the biggest challenges job seekers face is ensuring their resume clearly reflects the requirements of the role they’re applying for. Even experienced professionals can fall into the trap of having hidden gaps—not because they lack the skills, but because their resume doesn’t connect the dots for hiring managers.🔎 Common Gaps That Can Hurt Your Application: ❌ Industry-Specific Experience – Having healthcare experience doesn’t always mean you have direct exposure to provider data integration or claims processing. Tailor your resume to show exact experience in the niche area.❌ Technical Skills – Many roles now require familiarity with tools like Azure DevOps, MS Project, or SQL. If you have experience but haven’t listed it, you’re missing an opportunity to showcase your qualifications.❌ Project Scope & Impact – Saying you’ve “led projects” is great, but what kind of projects? Were they large-scale data integrations? System migrations? Give details that match the job’s expectations.❌ Regulatory & Compliance Knowledge – If a job mentions HIPAA, CMS, or other regulations, make sure your resume explicitly shows your experience working within those guidelines.✅ How to Fix It: 🔹 Mirror the job description – Use keywords from the posting that apply to your experience. 🔹 Be specific – Instead of “Managed healthcare operations,” say “Led a provider data integration project ensuring compliance with CMS and HIPAA.” 🔹 Highlight tools & technologies – Even if it wasn’t your main focus, mention exposure to data platforms, analytics tools, or automation systems. 🔹 Quantify your impact – Show how your work improved efficiency, compliance, or cost savings.Your resume isn’t just a list of jobs—it’s your personal marketing tool. The more tailored and strategic you are, the better your chances of landing the role.
