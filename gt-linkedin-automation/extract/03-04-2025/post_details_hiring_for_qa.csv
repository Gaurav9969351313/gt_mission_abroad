Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

This approach requires creative thinking that goes far beyond standard QA.2️⃣ Post-deployment testing is becoming as important as pre-release verification. For teams building or implementing AI systems: your testing strategy needs to evolve. What's your organization doing to adapt its testing approach for AI systems?

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

This approach requires creative thinking that goes far beyond standard QA.2️⃣ Post-deployment testing is becoming as important as pre-release verification. For teams building or implementing AI systems: your testing strategy needs to evolve. What's your organization doing to adapt its testing approach for AI systems?

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

This approach requires creative thinking that goes far beyond standard QA.2️⃣ Post-deployment testing is becoming as important as pre-release verification. For teams building or implementing AI systems: your testing strategy needs to evolve. What's your organization doing to adapt its testing approach for AI systems?

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best.

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Ashish D.Ashish D.,,"I've always maintained that - LLMs greatest selling-point is that they've solved ""search"" better than existing players like Google and Bing and this means entry to mid level specialists jobs can to a degree be replaced by generalists now. So yea, you don't necessarily need under 3-5 YOE devops or QA folks. I've seen junior devs transition smoothly into jobs advertised as ""Cloud Engineer"" with good documentation and mentoring - because they leverage LLMs well.Subject matter experts and high-agency ICs however will continue being a norm and have a size-able market for hiring for at-least half a decade if not more. Expertise automation is nowhere near on the horizon. SMEs don't hallucinate, unless they are under-caffeinated 😵‍💫 What do you guys think ?

Hannah DeasonHannah Deason,,"I know the job market is feeling intimidating and overwhelming for so many in our space right now. With new tariffs coming through — we remain unsure of what’s to come. In some ways, the future feels as scary and unfamiliar as February/March 2020 — when we didn’t know what we would lose or what it would mean. The future is* brighter than it feels, but that doesn’t help right now. What does help is building connections, sharing and supporting hiring efforts, and being transparent about hiring and needs. Some of the things we are doing at Caxy: — We’ve consolidated our hiring down to the most active roles we are hiring for right now to help with how folks spend their energy. — We are also creating more space for new folks to enter our world with our annual internship program set to start in June (applications open in end of April/early May) for dev, data science, QA, PM, and UX roles. Some additional things I would love to help do: — If I have a connection you want, reach me and I’ll setup an intro. — if you need a recruiter or staffing connection, reach me. — if you want a 30 minute resume review- send them my way. I would love to help. — if you’re wanting some career space, I’m opening up my calendar for my annual mini-coaching. I have 12 spots open. — if you are open to work, I’ll repost your notes for visibility. — and finally — if you have skills you think Caxy could benefit from, let’s talk.Wishing you all the best. I’m here with you 🖤

"Crystal Taggart, MBACrystal Taggart, MBA",,"Sharing that Ayush K and Replit CEO are BOTH wrong. Please don't listen to fools who clearly aren't using these tools. They are leaders who have forgotten how to get their hands dirty.1. AI is NOW coding and it's getting better. Soon 80-90% of software will be built with AI automatons. The only question is when.2. Code is a LANGUAGE to describe to a computer WHAT to do. Software development is not writing code. It's a way to describe to a computer what you want in their language. 3. The computers can now talk to us in OUR language. You still need software design skills (process, workflow, integration, UX, QA etc) but you won't need to code for most tasks. But you do need to know how to THINK.4. The AI companies are building the tools to do the above. They need people to do that - until they won't. Of course they are hiring. 5. You WILL still need to understand what happens in the sausage factory. Having fundamental skills in python, HTML, and SQL will be helpful in giving you MORE words to collaborate with your AI friends. Also, I don't recommend Replit. I created a POC with it and it's not amazing. Applied there last year and never got an interview. (Not bitter, just for transparency.) I built a POC for a training application and the way their UX works is VERY brittle and their code is very slow. They didn't even support an icon in a button until August of last year. I recommend real code instead of these inefficient complex wrappers.

Ashish D.Ashish D.,,"I've always maintained that - LLMs greatest selling-point is that they've solved ""search"" better than existing players like Google and Bing and this means entry to mid level specialists jobs can to a degree be replaced by generalists now. So yea, you don't necessarily need under 3-5 YOE devops or QA folks. I've seen junior devs transition smoothly into jobs advertised as ""Cloud Engineer"" with good documentation and mentoring - because they leverage LLMs well.Subject matter experts and high-agency ICs however will continue being a norm and have a size-able market for hiring for at-least half a decade if not more. Expertise automation is nowhere near on the horizon. SMEs don't hallucinate, unless they are under-caffeinated 😵‍💫 What do you guys think ?
