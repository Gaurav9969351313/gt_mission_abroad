George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me. Let’s get these folks back where they belong: building great things.

🤡⃢👺 Politico Loco🤡⃢👺 Politico Loco,,"𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐨 𝐄𝐥𝐞𝐳 𝐑𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞: 𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐲𝓘𝓷 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓿𝓪𝓼𝓽 𝓪𝓻𝓮𝓷𝓪 𝓸𝓯 𝓰𝓸𝓿𝓮𝓻𝓷𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽 𝓻𝓮𝓯𝓸𝓻𝓶, 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓵 𝓶𝓸𝓭𝓮𝓵𝓼 𝓪𝓻𝓮 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓯𝓸𝓻𝓶𝓮𝓻 𝓢𝓹𝓪𝓬𝓮𝓧 𝓹𝓻𝓸𝓰𝓻𝓪𝓶𝓶𝓮𝓻𝓼 𝔀𝓲𝓽𝓱 𝓻𝓪𝓬𝓲𝓼𝓽 𝓽𝔀𝓮𝓮𝓽𝓼.Marko Elez, 25, who recently tested the theory that hate speech is only career-ending if you’re not part of the Musk-Trump digital patronage pipeline, has been rehired to oversee sensitive federal data. Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase.

At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase. But hey, if that wasn’t enough to destroy the industry, the MBAs and Product teams are laying off everyone to cook the books and flip tech companies for $$$. They don’t give a chit about “that IT cost center.”Are you pissed off yet?  You should be.

George JengGeorge Jeng,,"When I joined Tumblr, I was blown away by what it meant to work at true scale. Millions of users. Countless data points. Infrastructure pushed to its limits. At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase. But hey, if that wasn’t enough to destroy the industry, the MBAs and Product teams are laying off everyone to cook the books and flip tech companies for $$$. They don’t give a chit about “that IT cost center.”Are you pissed off yet?  You should be.

At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase. But hey, if that wasn’t enough to destroy the industry, the MBAs and Product teams are laying off everyone to cook the books and flip tech companies for $$$. They don’t give a chit about “that IT cost center.”Are you pissed off yet?  You should be.

At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase. But hey, if that wasn’t enough to destroy the industry, the MBAs and Product teams are laying off everyone to cook the books and flip tech companies for $$$. They don’t give a chit about “that IT cost center.”Are you pissed off yet?  You should be.

At that level, most off-the-shelf tools simply break. What works elsewhere doesn’t cut it here — and the people who make it all run are some of the smartest, most dedicated folks I’ve ever met.This morning, some of those incredible colleagues were laid off.These aren’t just great engineers, PMs, researchers, marketers, and data scientists — they’re thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who built systems that most teams will never even encounter in their careers. They care deeply about their craft and about the people they build for.If you're hiring — or even just open to a conversation — I’d love to connect you. I will personally vouch for them.DM me.

Because what’s a little anti-Indian sentiment between friends, right? Especially when your new boss is Elon Musk, whose definition of “government efficiency” seems to involve running HR through Reddit polls.Yes, after the nation bravely survived the trauma of Elez’s brief resignation, Musk asked Twitter if he should bring him back. The platform, known for its sober deliberations and civil discourse, overwhelmingly voted: “Sure, why not give the guy with ‘Normalize Indian hate’ posts another crack at the Treasury’s payment systems?”In a surprising twist, Vice President JD Vance (whose wife is Indian!) backed the return, stating, “Stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” It’s a brave stand for Vance—finally giving a voice to the voiceless: the persecuted class of software engineers who just can’t stop tweeting ethnic slurs.The Trump administration insists Elez now only has “read-only” access. That’s comforting. Because if there’s anything we’ve learned from tech bros, it’s that “read-only” access is always obeyed—just like speed limits in a rented McLaren.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝: “𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚’𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.”But like any good tech product, you’ve got to read the fine print: “Terms and conditions apply. Offer not valid for minorities, career professionals, or anyone who’s ever read the Constitution.”This satirical summary was written by an AI, because when your government’s hiring policy sounds like a prank post from 4chan, it’s only fair your news gets written by a chatbot.https://lnkd.in/gu3D9KSg

Dale P.Dale P.,,"It’s worse than you could possibly imagine. Compound all that nonsense with this dumbass move by companies forcing their IT staff back into an office. Yet their data and software is in a 100% remote cloud. Despite the fact that the top 5 tech companies on planet Earth all created real-time chat and video conferencing software. We have phones and texting capabilities too. But forget that, back to the office. Pollute the planet with more traffic, and let’s all cough together in the cramped spaces. They had some awesome engineers who lost jobs because they were remote. As in, out of state remote. A lot of engineers. Oh, but hiring offshore development teams is okay. WTF?!They are forcing everyone to use AI for everything. It’s garbage. The code that comes out is trash that has to be rebuilt from scratch to maintain consistency. Don’t even Claude me…I use it for simplistic code examples, not for ANYTHING I would put directly into my codebase. But hey, if that wasn’t enough to destroy the industry, the MBAs and Product teams are laying off everyone to cook the books and flip tech companies for $$$. They don’t give a chit about “that IT cost center.”Are you pissed off yet?  You should be.
