A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Ray HuangRay Huang,,"Ever wonder what the Dark Side of Networking looks like? 👻 💼When someone submits a ghost referral using your name without your knowledge it can lead to a range of issues for both parties. A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way. Trust and integrity go a long way in the hiring process.Do you have a referral horror story?

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

I know a lot of seekers and try to share relevant or interesting roles with my people. So when I saw this one, I was like “Oh! I know some people who would love this!” 🤩Until I kept reading. 🧐It’s clearly marked Remote—*not* Hybrid—but keep reading, and you’ll see that you’re expected to be onsite 3 days a week here in beautiful NC. Maybe that will work for some folks! But what about the people who trusted your “Remote” assertion? The best applicants will read thoroughly, of course, but folks are tired, scared, and yeah, desperate. 😩This is a shady tactic and it’s got to stop. Mistakes happen, but this one?

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕

A ghost referral can backfire on the in several ways:🚫 Instant Rejection – If the hiring team realizes the referral was unauthorized, it could raise red flags and lead to immediate disqualification.🔄 Damaged Credibility – If you’re caught misusing someone’s name, it signals dishonesty and lack of professionalism, harming your reputation before you even get a chance to interview.📉 Lost Future Opportunities – Many companies track applications, and a bad impression now could impact your chances if you apply again in the future.⏳ Wasted Time for Hiring Teams – Recruiters prioritize referrals because they assume they come with a personal endorsement. A ghost referral can waste valuable resources on unqualified candidates.💼 It Could Impact the Future Referrals – If this happens too often, actual referrals might carry less weight, making it harder to help people that deserves the support.Instead of trying to take shortcuts, focus on building genuine relationships and earning a referral the right way.

Raphael SandorRaphael Sandor,,"The versatility of Java has given the language a long life. The thing that always amazes me is what you can build with Java and there are probably some well supported tools for just about any problem from full stack applications (Vaadin TymeLeaf), micro web services (Javalin), cluster applications (Spark, Pinot) to CLIs (PicoCLI) all in this languages ecosystem. It may not necessarily be the fastest language with Rust, Golang, and C++ holding the native stick, but then again we see even here GraalVM has come to give you nearly C speeds. The library, and ecosystem support is phenomenal. When I write other languages I don't have the myriad of frameworks to simplify common problems to allow me to focus on what matters (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus to name a few), the fact that I can name more than one high quality production ready framework is something most languages don't have. Additionally you can develop your applications intentionally as you want, employing design patterns. Lastly, after spending time in other communities you won't hear a Java developer say 'yeah that's by design, that...', for poorly orchestrated language features, we acknowledge they exist and simply agree that not everything in the language is perfect. ☕
