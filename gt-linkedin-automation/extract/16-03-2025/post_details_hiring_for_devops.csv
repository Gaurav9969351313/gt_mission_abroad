stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

After your design is complete, I'll hire a separate person to implement it. Your design must include CloudFormation templates, automated scaling policies, and self-healing capabilities.""Stop treating cloud infrastructure like it needs constant attention. The best infrastructure is the one you forget exists.

stevy Monkam Naktakwenstevy Monkam Naktakwen,,"üöÄ CI/CD Automation: A Strategic Asset for Businesses üí°In a world where fast and reliable deployments are essential, DevOps automation is becoming a key lever for businesses. My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.

My project allowed me to explore this reality by implementing a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab with Docker and Heroku to automate the lifecycle of a web application.üéØ Why is automation crucial for businesses?‚úÖ Time Saving & Error ReductionWith a CI/CD pipeline, there's no need for repetitive manual tasks! Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error and accelerating production.‚úÖ Code Reliability & QualityAutomated testing after each commit ensures product stability before it reaches users. This reduces bugs in production and improves the customer experience.‚úÖ Agility & Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof InnovationTeams can deliver new features faster thanks to optimized development cycles. Updates are more frequent, and time-to-market is reduced.‚úÖ Resource OptimizationBy automatically shutting down unused test environments (e.g., review apps), we avoid wasting cloud resources and reduce infrastructure costs.üìå This project allowed me to see how CI/CD automation can accelerate performance for businesses.Today, adopting a DevOps approach is no longer an option, but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.üìå The source code is available here: https://lnkd.in/dpCWib7cüí¨ Have you already implemented a CI/CD pipeline in your projects?

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi Consulting Boom: What‚Äôs Really Happening on the GroundFor years, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs consulting market has been in overdrive. The government‚Äôs Vision 2030 initiatives, giga-projects, and major developments created an unprecedented demand for external expertise. Consulting firms, big and small, rushed in, staffing up at record speed, and hiring became a frenzy.But things are changing.According to the FT, Saudi‚Äôs consulting sector saw explosive growth‚Äî38% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. This year the forecast suggest just 13% growth. The era of ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù consulting, where firms could charge sky-high fees and scale up without limits, is coming to an end.The Saudi government is tightening its spending and scrutinising the vast sums paid to external consultants. High-profile moves like PwC‚Äôs year-long ban from new advisory work signal a shift. There‚Äôs growing pressure to deliver results, not just strategies, and that has changed the hiring landscape dramatically.What Does This Mean for Recruitment?As a business that has been deeply involved in staffing for consulting firms, we‚Äôve seen this transition firsthand.A couple of years ago, hiring was high-volume, fast-moving, and, in some cases, excessive. Consultants were deployed in droves to support giga-projects, and firms scaled. The priority was speed, get teams in, deliver, and keep the machine running.Now the hiring dynamic has completely changed. ‚Ä¢	Companies are far more selective. Instead of just adding headcount, they‚Äôre looking for specialist expertise ‚Ä¢	Margins are under pressure. The competition for work has intensified, and consulting firms are discounting fees to win business, directly impacting hiring budgets. ‚Ä¢	Cost efficiency is key. Many firms are restructuring their teams, relying more on in-house capabilities, and re-evaluating their dependency on external consultants.Why We‚Äôre On the Ground in SaudiRecognising this shift early, we made a strategic decision, we‚Äôre now fully licensed and operational on the ground in Saudi Arabia.Because in this new environment, relationships, local market knowledge, and agility matter more than ever.Having boots on the ground means we can: ‚Ä¢	Work directly with clients to understand their evolving needs. ‚Ä¢	Help firms adapt their hiring strategies to prioritise value-driven, specialised hires rather than mass recruitment. ‚Ä¢	Stay ahead of policy and regulatory changes that impact talent acquisition in the kingdom.The opportunity in KSA is still enormous. The government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, mega-events, and economic diversification. The way business is being done is shifting.Companies that recognise these changes, adapt quickly, and focus on strategic hiring, not just scaling will be the ones that win.This shift isn‚Äôt being talked about enough. But it‚Äôs happening, do you see it?Photo - boarding a plane with the blue suit brigade Link to FT in comments.
