Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically.

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

I’d use resumes to filter candidates and schedule interviews—but once we got to the interview, I never looked at the resume.Why? Because by that point, I wasn’t interested in what was on paper—I wanted to get to know the person. Anyone can pay someone to write a great resume (heck, I’ve helped plenty of people with theirs). But you can’t hire someone to take the interview for you.Use resumes to schedule the interview. But when it’s time to hire, interview the person.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#InterviewTips

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic. The right talent might be outside the box you’ve drawn.We are Procurement. We outsource everything.hashtag#ProcurementOfficershashtag#ProcurementProfessionalshashtag#HiringProcurementhashtag#RecruitmentProfessionals

Ashby, Ed.D.",,"In 2017, I came across this fantastic piece on recruitment via Business Insider:“Brendan Browne’s favourite interview question: What are you most passionate about? Using the whiteboard, explain to me the process of how it works.Browne learns four things from this exercise:1. What do the candidates care about most deeply?2. How well can they explain themselves?3. How do they think about process?4. How do they deal with ambiguity?Browne subscribes to former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner’s belief that the ideal employee should fit into the overlap of three areas: dreaming big, knowing how to have fun, and getting s— done.” Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/gYrhbkqf

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically.

The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit.

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically.

Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

I’d use resumes to filter candidates and schedule interviews—but once we got to the interview, I never looked at the resume.Why? Because by that point, I wasn’t interested in what was on paper—I wanted to get to know the person. Anyone can pay someone to write a great resume (heck, I’ve helped plenty of people with theirs).

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

I’d use resumes to filter candidates and schedule interviews—but once we got to the interview, I never looked at the resume.Why? Because by that point, I wasn’t interested in what was on paper—I wanted to get to know the person. Anyone can pay someone to write a great resume (heck, I’ve helped plenty of people with theirs).

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic. The right talent might be outside the box you’ve drawn.We are Procurement. We outsource everything.hashtag#ProcurementOfficershashtag#ProcurementProfessionalshashtag#HiringProcurementhashtag#RecruitmentProfessionals

Ashby, Ed.D.",,"In 2017, I came across this fantastic piece on recruitment via Business Insider:“Brendan Browne’s favourite interview question: What are you most passionate about? Using the whiteboard, explain to me the process of how it works.Browne learns four things from this exercise:1. What do the candidates care about most deeply?2. How well can they explain themselves?3. How do they think about process?4. How do they deal with ambiguity?Browne subscribes to former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner’s belief that the ideal employee should fit into the overlap of three areas: dreaming big, knowing how to have fun, and getting s— done.” Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/gYrhbkqf

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Adilstone GroupAdilstone Group,,"Recruitment leaders, are you asking yourself these three questions?1️⃣ Is your hiring process built for efficiency or just tradition?-The best candidates are off the market in 10 days. If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness.

The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

If your process drags on, you're losing top talent.-Long interview loops can create frustration rather than accurately assess a candidate’s skills or potential.-A structured, high-impact process beats a long, outdated one. Speed, clarity, and candidate experience matter.2️⃣ Are you hiring for skills that won’t exist in five years?-AI and automation are reshaping roles, are you hiring for adaptability over hard skills?-Jobs that rely on routine tasks are evolving fast. The most valuable employees will be those who can learn, unlearn, and adapt.3️⃣ Are your hiring metrics telling the full story?-A fast hire isn’t a win if they’re the wrong fit. Are you tracking long-term success, not just time-to-hire?-Retention, performance, and cultural fit should matter more than speed alone.💡Quick Tip – The best hiring teams focus on creating a streamlined process, embracing future-ready skills, and measuring long-term success.For Professionals – Stay ahead of the curve – explore our job board and subscribe to our newsletter for future trends.For Hiring Leaders – Prepare for the future of talent acquisition – schedule a discovery call to learn more.hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#GlobalRecruitment hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#HiringLeaders hashtag#AIinHR

Vic HuVic Hu,,"Rethinking Recruiting: Beyond Resumes and InterviewsIn the world of talent acquisition, two critical questions should drive every hiring decision:1. Can this candidate consistently deliver exceptional results?2. Do they possess the intrinsic motivation and agency to excel?Traditional recruiting methods—endless resume screenings and standard interviews—often miss the mark. The most effective approaches are surprisingly straightforward:1. Seek authentic insights from past colleagues who can vouch for the candidate's real-world performance2. Implement meaningful trial periods that reveal true work capabilities and cultural fitThink of hiring like a high-stakes relationship: you're not just filling a role, but finding a strategic partner who can dramatically elevate your team's performance.The productivity gap between top and mediocre knowledge workers is staggering—sometimes 10-100x. Conversely, a poor hire can significantly erode team effectiveness. As AI continues to transform workforce dynamics, the premium on human excellence has never been higher.In the age of LLMs, asking the right questions matters more than having all the answers prepared.hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#WorkplaceTrends

Because by that point, I wasn’t interested in what was on paper—I wanted to get to know the person. Anyone can pay someone to write a great resume (heck, I’ve helped plenty of people with theirs).

Aisha Jad ReambilloAisha Jad Reambillo,,"Have you ever been told that your procurement experience doesn’t align with a recruiter’s industry requirements?It’s unfortunate how often talented professionals are overlooked simply because they haven’t worked in a specific industry.“Sorry, we’re looking for someone with experience in Food & Beverage… Construction… Oil & Gas… Healthcare…”Sound familiar?Procurement skills are highly transferable. The ability to negotiate, manage suppliers, optimize costs, and drive efficiency isn’t limited to one industry. By narrowing the talent pool based on sector experience alone, recruiters may be missing out on exceptional candidates who bring fresh perspectives, stronger procurement expertise, and a track record of delivering results.Instead of dismissing candidates outright, take the time to review their experience holistically. If their background is strong and their skills align with the role, give them a chance. After all, the hiring process is about finding the best fit—why not start by expanding the possibilities?Be open. Be strategic.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer
