David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Abyes khanAbyes khan,,"Why Are QA Automation Testers Struggling to Find Jobs Lately?The current job market for QA Automation testers seems to be growing more competitive. Many recruiters and hiring managers tend to place a heavy emphasis on advanced Java concepts, which are seldom relevant to day-to-day testing tasks. While Java knowledge is important, automation testing roles are typically more focused on practical skills such as working with tools like Selenium, API testing (e.g., RestAssured), CI/CD pipelines, and BDD frameworks like Cucumber.Rather than assessing real-world automation challenges and the ability to develop solid automation frameworks, candidates often find themselves facing tough coding problems that don’t align with the skills required in their daily work.By shifting the interview focus towards real-world problem-solving, debugging expertise, and CI/CD integration, companies can identify the right candidates and ensure they are evaluated based on the most critical skills for the job.What do you think? Share your thoughts on how interviews could be improved and why a focus on practical skills matters more.hashtag#AutomationTesting hashtag#QA hashtag#Selenium hashtag#API hashtag#CICD hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#HiringTrends hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CareerGrowth

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Abyes khanAbyes khan,,"Why Are QA Automation Testers Struggling to Find Jobs Lately?The current job market for QA Automation testers seems to be growing more competitive. Many recruiters and hiring managers tend to place a heavy emphasis on advanced Java concepts, which are seldom relevant to day-to-day testing tasks. While Java knowledge is important, automation testing roles are typically more focused on practical skills such as working with tools like Selenium, API testing (e.g., RestAssured), CI/CD pipelines, and BDD frameworks like Cucumber.Rather than assessing real-world automation challenges and the ability to develop solid automation frameworks, candidates often find themselves facing tough coding problems that don’t align with the skills required in their daily work.By shifting the interview focus towards real-world problem-solving, debugging expertise, and CI/CD integration, companies can identify the right candidates and ensure they are evaluated based on the most critical skills for the job.What do you think? Share your thoughts on how interviews could be improved and why a focus on practical skills matters more.hashtag#AutomationTesting hashtag#QA hashtag#Selenium hashtag#API hashtag#CICD hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#HiringTrends hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CareerGrowth

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Abyes khanAbyes khan,,"Why Are QA Automation Testers Struggling to Find Jobs Lately?The current job market for QA Automation testers seems to be growing more competitive. Many recruiters and hiring managers tend to place a heavy emphasis on advanced Java concepts, which are seldom relevant to day-to-day testing tasks. While Java knowledge is important, automation testing roles are typically more focused on practical skills such as working with tools like Selenium, API testing (e.g., RestAssured), CI/CD pipelines, and BDD frameworks like Cucumber.Rather than assessing real-world automation challenges and the ability to develop solid automation frameworks, candidates often find themselves facing tough coding problems that don’t align with the skills required in their daily work.By shifting the interview focus towards real-world problem-solving, debugging expertise, and CI/CD integration, companies can identify the right candidates and ensure they are evaluated based on the most critical skills for the job.What do you think? Share your thoughts on how interviews could be improved and why a focus on practical skills matters more.hashtag#AutomationTesting hashtag#QA hashtag#Selenium hashtag#API hashtag#CICD hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#HiringTrends hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CareerGrowth

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Abyes khanAbyes khan,,"Why Are QA Automation Testers Struggling to Find Jobs Lately?The current job market for QA Automation testers seems to be growing more competitive. Many recruiters and hiring managers tend to place a heavy emphasis on advanced Java concepts, which are seldom relevant to day-to-day testing tasks. While Java knowledge is important, automation testing roles are typically more focused on practical skills such as working with tools like Selenium, API testing (e.g., RestAssured), CI/CD pipelines, and BDD frameworks like Cucumber.Rather than assessing real-world automation challenges and the ability to develop solid automation frameworks, candidates often find themselves facing tough coding problems that don’t align with the skills required in their daily work.By shifting the interview focus towards real-world problem-solving, debugging expertise, and CI/CD integration, companies can identify the right candidates and ensure they are evaluated based on the most critical skills for the job.What do you think? Share your thoughts on how interviews could be improved and why a focus on practical skills matters more.hashtag#AutomationTesting hashtag#QA hashtag#Selenium hashtag#API hashtag#CICD hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#HiringTrends hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CareerGrowth
