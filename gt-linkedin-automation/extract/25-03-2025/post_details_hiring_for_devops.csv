They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment

Bia RanaBia Rana,,"Beyond the Job Description: The Talent You're Probably OverlookingFounders, here’s the truth: If you're only seeing what’s in someone’s job title…You’re missing out on their real value.In startups and lean teams, every hire matters.But here’s where we go wrong: We hire someone for marketing, ops, or admin—and forget to ask: 💡 What else can they do? 💡 What lights them up? 💡 What untapped skills are we not using?One of the best-kept secrets of high-functioning teams? They don't just hire talent—they discover it.Your project manager might be a brilliant UX thinker. Your content writer might have sharp product instincts. Your customer support rep could be a natural community builder.You don't need a bigger team. You need better visibility into the one you already have.✅ Here’s how to start uncovering hidden strengths:🔹 Ask beyond the role: “What do you love doing that we haven’t tapped into yet?"" 🔹 Create low-risk test projects: Let them lead outside their lane—watch what happens. 🔹 Host internal talent showcases: Short, fun sessions where team members show off a skill or passion project. 🔹 Give permission to explore: Make it okay to step outside the box—creativity thrives when it's welcomed.Small teams don’t need more people—they need more possibility thinking.✨ When you unlock hidden strengths, you build loyalty, energy, and growth—without increasing headcount.💬 Founders & team leads: What’s one hidden talent you discovered on your team—and how did you tap into it?Let’s share ideas 👇 hashtag#Startups hashtag#TeamDevelopment hashtag#FoundersTips hashtag#UnlockPotential hashtag#PeopleStrategy hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#TalentOptimization

David VerdudDavid Verdud,,"🚀 Severidad vs. Prioridad en el mundo del Testing QA 🐞Si trabajas en QA, seguro te has encontrado con el eterno debate: ¿Qué pesa más, la severidad o la prioridad de un bug? 🤔🔹 Severidad: Mide el impacto técnico del bug en el sistema. ¿Rompe una funcionalidad crítica, impide el uso del software o es solo un detalle visual? 🔹 Prioridad: Define la urgencia con la que debe corregirse. ¿El bug afecta a muchos usuarios? ¿Es un bloqueo para el negocio o puede esperar hasta el próximo sprint?💡 Un bug con severidad alta (ej. una pantalla en blanco en el login) no siempre es prioridad inmediata si tiene un workaround. En cambio, un bug con severidad baja (ej. un error tipográfico en la home) puede volverse prioritario si afecta una demo con clientes clave.⚡ El reto del Tester QA está en comunicar bien estos criterios y alinearse con el equipo de desarrollo y negocio para tomar las mejores decisiones.👉 Testers, cuéntenme: ¿Han tenido que justificar por qué un bug debe (o no) corregirse de inmediato? ¿Cuál ha sido su mayor reto decidiendo entre severidad y prioridad? ¡Los leo en comentarios! 💬hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#BugSeverity hashtag#BugPriority hashtag#TestingLife hashtag#AgileTesting hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#Scrum hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareQuality hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#TesterJobs hashtag#ITRecruitment
