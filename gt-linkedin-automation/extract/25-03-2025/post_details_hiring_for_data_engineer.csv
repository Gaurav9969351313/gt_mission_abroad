Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Having navigated these waters myself, from being a Master’s student to OPT to H1B to Green Card and being an Entrepreneur now, I know the uncertainty this creates for both talented professionals and the companies investing in them.Immigration policy is still a big question mark.Emerging technologies like AI/ML, Big data, Digital Twin, Cyber Security etc.. are no more alien terms for modern grid, and all these Tech run on worldwide talent. No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Having navigated these waters myself, from being a Master’s student to OPT to H1B to Green Card and being an Entrepreneur now, I know the uncertainty this creates for both talented professionals and the companies investing in them.Immigration policy is still a big question mark.Emerging technologies like AI/ML, Big data, Digital Twin, Cyber Security etc.. are no more alien terms for modern grid, and all these Tech run on worldwide talent. No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Having navigated these waters myself, from being a Master’s student to OPT to H1B to Green Card and being an Entrepreneur now, I know the uncertainty this creates for both talented professionals and the companies investing in them.Immigration policy is still a big question mark.Emerging technologies like AI/ML, Big data, Digital Twin, Cyber Security etc.. are no more alien terms for modern grid, and all these Tech run on worldwide talent. No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

Venkata Krishna PendurthiVenkata Krishna Pendurthi,,"Engineers on H-1B and L-1 visas fear US restrictions will limit opportunities, yet this shift could empower global talent to drive energy innovation.Experts say the federal government can't change visa caps, but they can tighten the process.So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Engineers on H-1B and L-1 visas fear US restrictions will limit opportunities, yet this shift could empower global talent to drive energy innovation.Experts say the federal government can't change visa caps, but they can tighten the process. So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Having navigated these waters myself, from being a Master’s student to OPT to H1B to Green Card and being an Entrepreneur now, I know the uncertainty this creates for both talented professionals and the companies investing in them.Immigration policy is still a big question mark.Emerging technologies like AI/ML, Big data, Digital Twin, Cyber Security etc.. are no more alien terms for modern grid, and all these Tech run on worldwide talent. No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

So, energy companies sponsoring visas may experience longer waits and increased denials.Having navigated these waters myself, from being a Master’s student to OPT to H1B to Green Card and being an Entrepreneur now, I know the uncertainty this creates for both talented professionals and the companies investing in them.Immigration policy is still a big question mark.Emerging technologies like AI/ML, Big data, Digital Twin, Cyber Security etc.. are no more alien terms for modern grid, and all these Tech run on worldwide talent. No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.

Sarah BrownSarah Brown,,"I joined Code Like a Girl in 2018 after attending their inaugural Adelaide event, with hundreds of people crammed into a cosy venue. I was so energised by the vision that Ally Watson OAM had for the future of the tech industry. I started by putting in a few hours a week as Education Lead in South Australia, and my role soon evolved to SA State Director. In 2020, I was offered a full-time role as Lead Technologist and joined the Leadership Team in 2024. The company went through several iterations during my time there, each bringing opportunities to work with amazing new people and innovative programs.Together, we accomplished things I’ll always be proud of.Led by some incredible program managers, we grew the wildly successful internship program, which has placed over 200 women and gender-diverse individuals in paid internships, and continues to place even more.I upskilled and led the full-stack development efforts for our internship placement platform/app, which centralised program data, automated many previously manual workflows, and provided easy interfaces for interns and hiring partners to manage their information.In just a few short months, we developed and released the School of Code for online coding education, seizing the opportunity to provide accessible learning during lockdowns.I taught hundreds of kids and adults through in-person workshops, code camps, tutor groups, and online sessions. One online workshop had over 400 attendees, we even crashed CodeSandbox 😅 I trained government employees to use Python for improving their workflows. I helped develop curriculums in C#, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. I facilitated panels, events, and webinars—including a session on the main stage at the Virtual Engineers Summit. Sadly, my role ended at the close of 2024. DEIB work is often underfunded, making it challenging to sustain engineering roles in this space. I get it. I'm grateful. I’ll always be part of this community. Code Like a Girl isn’t just a company; it’s a network, a movement, a heartbeat. I have met some of my dearest friends through Code Like a Girl. I’ll continue to show up as a community advocate, a mentor, and a fan.BUT a new adventure is beginning soon. I’m excited. 👀 Watch this space.

Hissan DanishHissan Danish,,"My interview experience with Goldman Sachs for the SDE-2 (Associate Software Engineer) role:There was an online assessment and a phone screening round comprising of medium and hard DSA problems prior to the onsite rounds. The onsite interviews were interesting and different from traditional ones. Each round had two interviewers who actively cross-questioned me, so the pressure was a bit high.Onsite Round 1: DSA Round – Two LeetCode medium problems + one follow-up question.Onsite Round 2: Software Engineering Practices Round – This was the most interesting round. I was grilled on my current projects, HLD of rate limiting, different authentication strategies, REST vs GraphQL, JSON vs Protobuf, Java internals, and Java OOP concepts.Onsite Round 3: Design Round – I was asked about the LLD of a flight booking service, database choice questions, and designing a service to validate millions of records from a text file (without using data processing frameworks like Spark). There were also questions on multithreading, concurrency, and Java.Onsite Round 4: Hiring Manager Round – Focused on my resume, projects, and general behavioral questions.I felt I hadn’t performed well, but to my surprise, I cleared all the rounds!In hindsight, what worked for me was:1. Staying calm and not panicking over unfamiliar questions.2. Even though I hadn’t revised Java or design topics, I thought logically about what the correct behavior should be and answered accordingly.3. Most importantly, I treated each interview as a learning opportunity and turned them into engaging discussions.You either win or you learn!hashtag#interview hashtag#goldmansachs hashtag#softwareengineer

No way around it.Tech companies keeps ramping up global hiring, despite calls for restrictions.(Tesla's H-1B numbers shot up to 700+ in 2024.)Critics accuse companies of exploiting the visa system for cheap foreign talent to pad profits.Sure, economic arbitrage is real.But so is the US energy sector's looming 80,000-worker shortage by 2030.(No talent to innovate smart grids, modernization, or renewables.)More than 25% of the US's electrical engineers are foreign.The country needs H-1B and L-1 visa talent to maintain its competitive edge.If US visa restrictions tighten, companies will likely “park” staff in immigration-friendly countries.Opportunities exist well beyond any single market.Though not ideal, international talent can also accelerate clean energy development in Europe, Asia, and Africa.Right now, it's difficult to predict anything.Meanwhile, companies hiring H-1B and L-1 talent in the US should brace for increased legal fees and new compliance requirements.Do you think this is a watershed moment for international talent in the US or just political theater?Sources: Sources: NPR, S&P Global, and Power TechnologyVideo Credit: Business Standard⚡ Follow me for no-nonsense insights on power systems, protection engineering, and the energy transition.
