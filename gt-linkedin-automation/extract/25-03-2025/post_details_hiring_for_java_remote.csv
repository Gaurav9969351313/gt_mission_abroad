Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()!

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Harsh SharmaHarsh Sharma,,"Interview Question:Can static Methods Be Overridden in Java? 🤔No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic (runtime) polymorphism, and static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).However, you can redefine a static method in a subclass, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.eg:class Parent { static void display() { System.out.println(""Static method in Parent""); }}class Child extends Parent { static void display() { // This is NOT overriding, it's hiding System.out.println(""Static method in Child""); }}public class MethodHidingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Parent obj1 = new Parent(); obj1.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent Child obj2 = new Child(); obj2.display(); // Output: Static method in Child Parent obj3 = new Child(); obj3.display(); // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child!) }}hashtag#Java hashtag#Spring hashtag#Springboot hashtag#MySQL hashtag#JavaDeveloper

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

Ankit RaiAnkit Rai,,"In Java, when dealing with strings, we often need to remove unnecessary whitespace. Two methods that are commonly used for this purpose are strip() and trim(). While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shubham SinghShubham Singh,,"🚀 The ‘final’ Keyword – More Powerful Than You Think! 🔥Most Java developers use final casually—but do you really know its full potential? This small yet powerful keyword can drastically improve performance, security, and maintainability when used wisely.💡 Let’s break it down:✅ Final Variables (final int x = 10;) – Once assigned, they cannot be changed. This ensures thread safety for immutable objects.✅ Final Methods – Prevents method overriding. Great for securing core business logic from unintended modifications.✅ Final Classes (final class Utility {}) – Stops inheritance completely (like String and Wrapper classes). This boosts security and avoids unpredictable behavior.⚡ Performance Boost: JVM optimizations like method inlining work better with final, leading to faster execution.🔄 Thread Safety: In concurrent programming, final ensures safe publication of shared variables without explicit synchronization.✨ Hidden Benefit: Ever noticed that all variables in lambda expressions must be final (or effectively final)? That’s because it guarantees predictability in closures.🔥 Takeaway: final isn’t just about preventing changes—it’s a performance booster, bug reducer, and a safeguard against unintended modifications!👀 Do you actively use final in your code? Let me know in the comments! ⬇️👉 Follow me for more Java insights, hidden features, and performance hacks! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#CodeOptimization

While both remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, they behave differently.1️⃣ trim() Method ✂️The trim() method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.It removes only basic whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines (ASCII values 0-32).Note 👉 : trim() does not affect non-whitespace characters, and it may not handle characters with higher Unicode values properly.2️⃣ strip() Method (Java 11 and later) 🔑👉 The strip() method, introduced in Java 11, removes leading and trailing whitespace just like trim(), but it handles all Unicode whitespace characters (not just ASCII).👉 It is more comprehensive than trim() and can handle characters like non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), which trim() cannot.Key Differences 🔍:👉 Unicode Handling: trim() is limited to removing only ASCII whitespace characters, whereas strip() handles all Unicode whitespace.👉 Recommended Usage: If you're working with text in modern Java versions (Java 11+), prefer strip() for better Unicode support. Use trim() if you're working in earlier Java versions or specifically need to remove ASCII whitespace.Takeaway 📝:If you're looking for a more robust solution that handles all kinds of whitespace characters, go for strip()! If you're working with older versions of Java or only care about ASCII spaces, trim() still works perfectly fine.Happy coding! 🚀hashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#Java11 hashtag#StringHandling hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#TechTips hashtag#JavaDevelopment
