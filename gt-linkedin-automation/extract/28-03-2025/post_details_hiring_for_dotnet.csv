Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

I was invited to present what we Balfour Beatty plc are doing to attract future hashtag#Apprentices in to hashtag#BalfourBeatty. The slide which got the most discussion was the second image attached. The pathway to be a recognised professional. This shows not only the education pathway but also the pathway to Member status with the hashtag#CICES and building letters behind your name whilst working.Colleges and Universities need the numbers to be able to run Level 3 Engineering Surveying Course across the country at hashtag#crontoncollege hashtag#dudleycollege hashtag#newsuffolkcollege and hashtag#T3We in hashtag#balfourbeatty have committed to 12 Level 3 Engineering Surveying Apprenticeships to join these colleges in September 2025.

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits.

Today was the L3 and L6 Geospatial Apprenticeship Trailblazer Group Meeting hosted by Lucy Powers BA (Hons), MBA, FInstCES and Alison Watson MBE. I was invited to present what we Balfour Beatty plc are doing to attract future hashtag#Apprentices in to hashtag#BalfourBeatty. The slide which got the most discussion was the second image attached. The pathway to be a recognised professional. This shows not only the education pathway but also the pathway to Member status with the hashtag#CICES and building letters behind your name whilst working.Colleges and Universities need the numbers to be able to run Level 3 Engineering Surveying Course across the country at hashtag#crontoncollege hashtag#dudleycollege hashtag#newsuffolkcollege and hashtag#T3We in hashtag#balfourbeatty have committed to 12 Level 3 Engineering Surveying Apprenticeships to join these colleges in September 2025. Also you dont have to just be on an Engineering Surveying career path - our hashtag#ProjectInformationManagement hashtag#BuildingInformationManagement hashtag#BIM hashtag#GIS apprentices can also join the Level 3 Geospatial Survey Technicain Apprenticeship as well to have a formal education whilst working.

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Use battle-tested tools. Your time is too valuable.2️⃣ hashtag#Unreadable CodeYou read code 10x more than you write it. Write for humans, not just compilers.3️⃣ hashtag#Ignoring SecurityValidate inputs. Follow least privilege. Prevention is cheaper (and safer) than cure.4️⃣#Tight CouplingClasses shouldn’t cling to implementations. Loosely coupled = easier to replace/modify.5️⃣ hashtag#Unhandled ExceptionsNever expose stack traces. Log details, return generic errors. Hackers love open books.6️⃣ hashtag#Hardcoded ValuesMagic numbers/strings turn updates into scavenger hunts. Use constants, configs, or databases. 7️⃣ hashtag#Poor Database DesignA bad structure slows apps and kills scalability. Optimize early, save headaches later.8️⃣ hashtag#Skipping Unit TestsNo time to write tests? You’ll spend it fixing avoidable bugs. Tests = your code’s safety net. 9️⃣ hashtag#No Logging/MonitoringAn app without logs is a plane without instruments. How will you diagnose mid-flight crashes?🔟 No Input hashtag#ValidationFix bad data? 10x harder than preventing it. Guard your data integrity like it’s sacred. Which mistake hurts teams the most?

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Loosely coupled = easier to replace/modify.5️⃣ hashtag#Unhandled ExceptionsNever expose stack traces. Log details, return generic errors. Hackers love open books.6️⃣ hashtag#Hardcoded ValuesMagic numbers/strings turn updates into scavenger hunts.

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

You never know who’s watching or what doors it might open.It’s been a self-driven journey that taught me a lot, and I’m proud of the impact I’ve made so far.”—————You can follow me hashtag#Ayat_Eldinhashtag#HR hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Jobs hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobHunting

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Use battle-tested tools. Your time is too valuable.2️⃣ hashtag#Unreadable CodeYou read code 10x more than you write it. Write for humans, not just compilers.3️⃣ hashtag#Ignoring SecurityValidate inputs. Follow least privilege. Prevention is cheaper (and safer) than cure.4️⃣#Tight CouplingClasses shouldn’t cling to implementations. Loosely coupled = easier to replace/modify.5️⃣ hashtag#Unhandled ExceptionsNever expose stack traces. Log details, return generic errors. Hackers love open books.6️⃣ hashtag#Hardcoded ValuesMagic numbers/strings turn updates into scavenger hunts. Use constants, configs, or databases. 7️⃣ hashtag#Poor Database DesignA bad structure slows apps and kills scalability. Optimize early, save headaches later.8️⃣ hashtag#Skipping Unit TestsNo time to write tests? You’ll spend it fixing avoidable bugs. Tests = your code’s safety net. 9️⃣ hashtag#No Logging/MonitoringAn app without logs is a plane without instruments. How will you diagnose mid-flight crashes?🔟 No Input hashtag#ValidationFix bad data? 10x harder than preventing it. Guard your data integrity like it’s sacred. Which mistake hurts teams the most?

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path.

Use battle-tested tools. Your time is too valuable.2️⃣ hashtag#Unreadable CodeYou read code 10x more than you write it. Write for humans, not just compilers.3️⃣ hashtag#Ignoring SecurityValidate inputs. Follow least privilege. Prevention is cheaper (and safer) than cure.4️⃣#Tight CouplingClasses shouldn’t cling to implementations. Loosely coupled = easier to replace/modify.5️⃣ hashtag#Unhandled ExceptionsNever expose stack traces. Log details, return generic errors. Hackers love open books.6️⃣ hashtag#Hardcoded ValuesMagic numbers/strings turn updates into scavenger hunts. Use constants, configs, or databases. 7️⃣ hashtag#Poor Database DesignA bad structure slows apps and kills scalability. Optimize early, save headaches later.8️⃣ hashtag#Skipping Unit TestsNo time to write tests? You’ll spend it fixing avoidable bugs. Tests = your code’s safety net. 9️⃣ hashtag#No Logging/MonitoringAn app without logs is a plane without instruments. How will you diagnose mid-flight crashes?🔟 No Input hashtag#ValidationFix bad data? 10x harder than preventing it. Guard your data integrity like it’s sacred. Which mistake hurts teams the most?

Mohammed Abd El-AleemMohammed Abd El-Aleem,,"ASP.NET Core: Map vs. UseWhen 🤔🟢 What’s the Difference? 🟢 When to Use Which? If you’ve ever worked with middleware in ASP.NET Core, you’ve probably come across Map and UseWhen. At first glance, they seem similar—but they serve different purposes! Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.🎯 Think of Map like a fork in the road.When a request matches a specific path, it permanently takes a separate route (middleware branch).Example: If the request starts with /admin, handle it differently from /user.·Once a request enters a Map branch, it does not return to the main pipeline.🎯 Now, UseWhen is like a side road that merges back.It conditionally applies middleware based on any condition (query params, headers, request type, etc.).But unlike Map, the request returns to the main pipeline afterward.🚀 Example: Imagine a Coffee Shop ☕️Think of an ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline like a coffee shop where customers (requests) come in, get their orders processed, and leave with a response.📌 Map → Separate Lanes for VIPs and Regular Customers In our coffee shop, we have two separate counters:One exclusively for VIP customers.Another for regular customers. If a customer goes to the VIP counter, they never interact with the regular counter.💡 How This Works:If a customer (request) enters /vip, they are directed only to the VIP Rest.If they go anywhere else (/, /home, etc.), they never see the VIP Lounge—they get the regular coffee experience.📌 UseWhen → Special Offers for Customers Wearing Glasses 🤓 Now, let's say the coffee shop offers a discount for customers wearing glasses, but they still follow the same ordering process as everyone else.If someone is wearing glasses, they get extra middleware (discount applied) but still follow the regular checkout.If they aren't wearing glasses, they simply proceed without the discount.💡 How This Works:If the request contains ?glasses=true, it applies the discount (executes the UseWhen middleware).But after the discount is applied, the request continues in the regular pipeline (everyone still gets coffee).If ?glasses=true is not present, the customer still gets coffee but without the discount.🎯 Use Map when requests should take completely separate paths (VIP vs. Regular customers).🎯 Use UseWhen when requests need temporary processing but should still follow the main flow (Glasses discount).

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Emilio Adán SorianoEmilio Adán Soriano,,"Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Denmark  🇩🇰 - without really knowing where to start.I didn’t speak Danish, I didn’t know anyone, I had no network... and even though I was full of motivation and eager to work in marketing, the reality wasn’t easy.The doors didn’t open. Many positions required fluent Danish – or they chose candidates with more experience than me. There were times when I thought it would never happen, that maybe it just wasn’t possible.But fate brought a very special person into my life: Oluf C. Lund.Oluf didn’t just offer his help – he gave me something far more valuable: trust, wisdom, and constant support every step of the way. He encouraged me to learn Danish, improve my professional profile, and – most importantly – not to give up. He gave me back hope, right when I needed it the most.Thanks to his support and our shared efforts, I can now say that I’ve been working for two and a half months as Junior Content Specialist at BoConcept – a company I truly admire, and where I feel lucky to grow every day surrounded by an amazing team. I learn something new every single day, and it’s both enriching and motivating.This post is for you, Oluf – thank you from the bottom of my heart.And also for those in my network who might be in a situation similar to the one I was in not long ago.Don’t give up. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, keep learning, be patient and – above all – trust your path. Sometimes, the first step is finding someone who believes in you before you believe in yourself.That’s the best advice I can give you.Thank you for everything, Oluf.

Christian AnichebeChristian Anichebe,,"hashtag#Don’t Let These .NET hashtag#Mistakes Haunt You.After 12,480+ hours building .NET apps, here are the 10 deadliest mistakes I’ve seen (and made myself):1️⃣ hashtag#Reinventing the WheelDon’t build ORMs/auth from scratch. Use battle-tested tools. Your time is too valuable.2️⃣ hashtag#Unreadable CodeYou read code 10x more than you write it. Write for humans, not just compilers.3️⃣ hashtag#Ignoring SecurityValidate inputs. Follow least privilege. Prevention is cheaper (and safer) than cure.4️⃣#Tight CouplingClasses shouldn’t cling to implementations. Loosely coupled = easier to replace/modify.5️⃣ hashtag#Unhandled ExceptionsNever expose stack traces. Log details, return generic errors. Hackers love open books.6️⃣ hashtag#Hardcoded ValuesMagic numbers/strings turn updates into scavenger hunts. Use constants, configs, or databases. 7️⃣ hashtag#Poor Database DesignA bad structure slows apps and kills scalability. Optimize early, save headaches later.8️⃣ hashtag#Skipping Unit TestsNo time to write tests? You’ll spend it fixing avoidable bugs. Tests = your code’s safety net. 9️⃣ hashtag#No Logging/MonitoringAn app without logs is a plane without instruments. How will you diagnose mid-flight crashes?🔟 No Input hashtag#ValidationFix bad data? 10x harder than preventing it. Guard your data integrity like it’s sacred. Which mistake hurts teams the most? Let me know below 👇Happy coding and enjoy your weekend! 🚀#.NET hashtag#Developement hashtag#BestPractices
