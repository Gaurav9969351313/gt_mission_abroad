Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mustafa ToaimaMustafa Toaima,,"DTO في Spring Boot ??🤔ليه بنستخدمه وازاي يفرق معاك؟👇🏻في مشاريعك، لو بترجع الـ Entities مباشرة من الـ API، فده ممكن يسبب مشاكل زي كشف تفاصيل غير ضرورية او senstive أو تحميل بيانات زيادة بدون داعيطب والحل ؟ استخدام DTO (Data Transfer Object)🔹 ليه نستخدم DTO؟✅ تحسين الأداء – إرسال البيانات المطلوبة فقط بدلاً من ال object بالكامل.✅ حماية ال senstive data – منع كشف المعلومات المهمة من الـ Entity.✅ فصل الطبقات – تقليل الاعتماد المباشر بين الـ Database والـ API.🔹 إزاي نستخدم DTO في Spring Boot؟📌 1. اعمل Class ل DTO:public class UserDTO { private String name; private String email; public UserDTO(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }}📌 2. تحويل Entity إلى DTO في الـ Service Layer: او استخدم (MapStruct)public UserDTO convertToDTO(User user) { return new UserDTO(user.getName(), user.getEmail());}📌 3. استخدام DTO في الـ Controller:@GetMapping(""/users/{id}"")public ResponseEntity<UserDTO> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { User user = userService.getUserById(id); return ResponseEntity.ok(convertToDTO(user));}✅ نصيحة: لو عندك تحويلات كتير او معقدة، استخدم MapStruct هتوفر وقت ومجهود بدل من كتابة التحويلات بنفسك دور عليها هتفيدك❤️ها انت بقي بتستخدم DTO في مشاريعك؟ ولا لسه بترجع الـ Entity مباشرة؟ 🤔ومتنساش لو في اي تعديل او معلومه ياريت تفيدني بيها واتمني تكون استفدت ولو بمعلومه بسيطه❤️hashtag#CodeWithToaima hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#Java hashtag#DTO hashtag#Backend hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Microservices hashtag#Coding hashtag#FullStack hashtag#Programming hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#SpringBootDevelopment hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#BackendEngineer hashtag#SpringBootTutorial hashtag#DTO hashtag#DataTransferObject hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#Microservices hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#APIDesign hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#FullStackDevelopment hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#DevLife

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mustafa ToaimaMustafa Toaima,,"DTO في Spring Boot ??🤔ليه بنستخدمه وازاي يفرق معاك؟👇🏻في مشاريعك، لو بترجع الـ Entities مباشرة من الـ API، فده ممكن يسبب مشاكل زي كشف تفاصيل غير ضرورية او senstive أو تحميل بيانات زيادة بدون داعيطب والحل ؟ استخدام DTO (Data Transfer Object)🔹 ليه نستخدم DTO؟✅ تحسين الأداء – إرسال البيانات المطلوبة فقط بدلاً من ال object بالكامل.✅ حماية ال senstive data – منع كشف المعلومات المهمة من الـ Entity.✅ فصل الطبقات – تقليل الاعتماد المباشر بين الـ Database والـ API.🔹 إزاي نستخدم DTO في Spring Boot؟📌 1. اعمل Class ل DTO:public class UserDTO { private String name; private String email; public UserDTO(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }}📌 2. تحويل Entity إلى DTO في الـ Service Layer: او استخدم (MapStruct)public UserDTO convertToDTO(User user) { return new UserDTO(user.getName(), user.getEmail());}📌 3. استخدام DTO في الـ Controller:@GetMapping(""/users/{id}"")public ResponseEntity<UserDTO> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { User user = userService.getUserById(id); return ResponseEntity.ok(convertToDTO(user));}✅ نصيحة: لو عندك تحويلات كتير او معقدة، استخدم MapStruct هتوفر وقت ومجهود بدل من كتابة التحويلات بنفسك دور عليها هتفيدك❤️ها انت بقي بتستخدم DTO في مشاريعك؟ ولا لسه بترجع الـ Entity مباشرة؟ 🤔ومتنساش لو في اي تعديل او معلومه ياريت تفيدني بيها واتمني تكون استفدت ولو بمعلومه بسيطه❤️hashtag#CodeWithToaima hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#Java hashtag#DTO hashtag#Backend hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Microservices hashtag#Coding hashtag#FullStack hashtag#Programming hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#SpringBootDevelopment hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#BackendEngineer hashtag#SpringBootTutorial hashtag#DTO hashtag#DataTransferObject hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#Microservices hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#APIDesign hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#FullStackDevelopment hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#DevLife

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 (𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = """"; for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed += str.charAt(i); // String concatenation } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n²) because Java strings are immutable, and each += operation creates a new string.Space Complexity: O(n) because a new string is stored in memory.𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:❌ Not recommended for large strings due to inefficient memory usage.2. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 (𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭)public class ReverseStringBuilderLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed.append(str.charAt(i)); // StringBuilder is mutable } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed.toString()); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (only one pass is made).Space Complexity: O(n) (since we store the reversed string).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Recommended over String concatenation (+=) because StringBuilder is mutable & efficient.3. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫.𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞() (𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringBuilderMethod { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:⏲️Complexity: O(n) (StringBuilder.reverse() iterates through the string once).🌌Complexity: O(n) (because a new string is created).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅✅ Best and simplest approach for reversing a string in Java.4. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫[] (𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseCharArray { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; char[] charArray = str.toCharArray(); int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1; while (left < right) { char temp = charArray[left]; charArray[left] = charArray[right]; charArray[right] = temp; left++; right--; } S.o.p(""Reversed String: "" + new String(charArray)); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (one pass through the array).Space Complexity: O(n) (because an extra char[] array is used).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Efficient & good for low-level manipulation but not as readable as StringBuilder.reverse().All other ways are unnecessary, one can try though.hashtag#StringOperationhashtag#fullStackDeveloper

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mustafa ToaimaMustafa Toaima,,"DTO في Spring Boot ??🤔ليه بنستخدمه وازاي يفرق معاك؟👇🏻في مشاريعك، لو بترجع الـ Entities مباشرة من الـ API، فده ممكن يسبب مشاكل زي كشف تفاصيل غير ضرورية او senstive أو تحميل بيانات زيادة بدون داعيطب والحل ؟ استخدام DTO (Data Transfer Object)🔹 ليه نستخدم DTO؟✅ تحسين الأداء – إرسال البيانات المطلوبة فقط بدلاً من ال object بالكامل.✅ حماية ال senstive data – منع كشف المعلومات المهمة من الـ Entity.✅ فصل الطبقات – تقليل الاعتماد المباشر بين الـ Database والـ API.🔹 إزاي نستخدم DTO في Spring Boot؟📌 1. اعمل Class ل DTO:public class UserDTO { private String name; private String email; public UserDTO(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }}📌 2. تحويل Entity إلى DTO في الـ Service Layer: او استخدم (MapStruct)public UserDTO convertToDTO(User user) { return new UserDTO(user.getName(), user.getEmail());}📌 3. استخدام DTO في الـ Controller:@GetMapping(""/users/{id}"")public ResponseEntity<UserDTO> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { User user = userService.getUserById(id); return ResponseEntity.ok(convertToDTO(user));}✅ نصيحة: لو عندك تحويلات كتير او معقدة، استخدم MapStruct هتوفر وقت ومجهود بدل من كتابة التحويلات بنفسك دور عليها هتفيدك❤️ها انت بقي بتستخدم DTO في مشاريعك؟ ولا لسه بترجع الـ Entity مباشرة؟ 🤔ومتنساش لو في اي تعديل او معلومه ياريت تفيدني بيها واتمني تكون استفدت ولو بمعلومه بسيطه❤️hashtag#CodeWithToaima hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#Java hashtag#DTO hashtag#Backend hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Microservices hashtag#Coding hashtag#FullStack hashtag#Programming hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#SpringBootDevelopment hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#BackendEngineer hashtag#SpringBootTutorial hashtag#DTO hashtag#DataTransferObject hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#Microservices hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#APIDesign hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#FullStackDevelopment hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#DevLife

Kapil BodhareKapil Bodhare,,"𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 1𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚:I have been wondering how many possible ways in which we can reverse a given string in Java. Answer is 7. Amazing ? Check out below:1. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 (𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = """"; for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed += str.charAt(i); // String concatenation } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n²) because Java strings are immutable, and each += operation creates a new string.Space Complexity: O(n) because a new string is stored in memory.𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:❌ Not recommended for large strings due to inefficient memory usage.2. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 (𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭)public class ReverseStringBuilderLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed.append(str.charAt(i)); // StringBuilder is mutable } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed.toString()); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (only one pass is made).Space Complexity: O(n) (since we store the reversed string).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Recommended over String concatenation (+=) because StringBuilder is mutable & efficient.3. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫.𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞() (𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringBuilderMethod { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:⏲️Complexity: O(n) (StringBuilder.reverse() iterates through the string once).🌌Complexity: O(n) (because a new string is created).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅✅ Best and simplest approach for reversing a string in Java.4.

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 (𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = """"; for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed += str.charAt(i); // String concatenation } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n²) because Java strings are immutable, and each += operation creates a new string.Space Complexity: O(n) because a new string is stored in memory.𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:❌ Not recommended for large strings due to inefficient memory usage.2. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 (𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭)public class ReverseStringBuilderLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed.append(str.charAt(i)); // StringBuilder is mutable } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed.toString()); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (only one pass is made).Space Complexity: O(n) (since we store the reversed string).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Recommended over String concatenation (+=) because StringBuilder is mutable & efficient.3. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫.𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞() (𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringBuilderMethod { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:⏲️Complexity: O(n) (StringBuilder.reverse() iterates through the string once).🌌Complexity: O(n) (because a new string is created).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅✅ Best and simplest approach for reversing a string in Java.4. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫[] (𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseCharArray { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; char[] charArray = str.toCharArray(); int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1; while (left < right) { char temp = charArray[left]; charArray[left] = charArray[right]; charArray[right] = temp; left++; right--; } S.o.p(""Reversed String: "" + new String(charArray)); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (one pass through the array).Space Complexity: O(n) (because an extra char[] array is used).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Efficient & good for low-level manipulation but not as readable as StringBuilder.reverse().All other ways are unnecessary, one can try though.hashtag#StringOperationhashtag#fullStackDeveloper

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mustafa ToaimaMustafa Toaima,,"DTO في Spring Boot ??🤔ليه بنستخدمه وازاي يفرق معاك؟👇🏻في مشاريعك، لو بترجع الـ Entities مباشرة من الـ API، فده ممكن يسبب مشاكل زي كشف تفاصيل غير ضرورية او senstive أو تحميل بيانات زيادة بدون داعيطب والحل ؟ استخدام DTO (Data Transfer Object)🔹 ليه نستخدم DTO؟✅ تحسين الأداء – إرسال البيانات المطلوبة فقط بدلاً من ال object بالكامل.✅ حماية ال senstive data – منع كشف المعلومات المهمة من الـ Entity.✅ فصل الطبقات – تقليل الاعتماد المباشر بين الـ Database والـ API.🔹 إزاي نستخدم DTO في Spring Boot؟📌 1. اعمل Class ل DTO:public class UserDTO { private String name; private String email; public UserDTO(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }}📌 2. تحويل Entity إلى DTO في الـ Service Layer: او استخدم (MapStruct)public UserDTO convertToDTO(User user) { return new UserDTO(user.getName(), user.getEmail());}📌 3. استخدام DTO في الـ Controller:@GetMapping(""/users/{id}"")public ResponseEntity<UserDTO> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { User user = userService.getUserById(id); return ResponseEntity.ok(convertToDTO(user));}✅ نصيحة: لو عندك تحويلات كتير او معقدة، استخدم MapStruct هتوفر وقت ومجهود بدل من كتابة التحويلات بنفسك دور عليها هتفيدك❤️ها انت بقي بتستخدم DTO في مشاريعك؟ ولا لسه بترجع الـ Entity مباشرة؟ 🤔ومتنساش لو في اي تعديل او معلومه ياريت تفيدني بيها واتمني تكون استفدت ولو بمعلومه بسيطه❤️hashtag#CodeWithToaima hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#Java hashtag#DTO hashtag#Backend hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Microservices hashtag#Coding hashtag#FullStack hashtag#Programming hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#SpringBootDevelopment hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#BackendEngineer hashtag#SpringBootTutorial hashtag#DTO hashtag#DataTransferObject hashtag#RESTAPI hashtag#Microservices hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#APIDesign hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#FullStackDevelopment hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#DevLife

Kapil BodhareKapil Bodhare,,"𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 1𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚:I have been wondering how many possible ways in which we can reverse a given string in Java. Answer is 7. Amazing ? Check out below:1. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 (𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = """"; for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed += str.charAt(i); // String concatenation } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n²) because Java strings are immutable, and each += operation creates a new string.Space Complexity: O(n) because a new string is stored in memory.𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:❌ Not recommended for large strings due to inefficient memory usage.2. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 (𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭)public class ReverseStringBuilderLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed.append(str.charAt(i)); // StringBuilder is mutable } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed.toString()); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (only one pass is made).Space Complexity: O(n) (since we store the reversed string).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Recommended over String concatenation (+=) because StringBuilder is mutable & efficient.3. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫.𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞() (𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringBuilderMethod { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:⏲️Complexity: O(n) (StringBuilder.reverse() iterates through the string once).🌌Complexity: O(n) (because a new string is created).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅✅ Best and simplest approach for reversing a string in Java.4.

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

I responded I like Jira (cumin)-Lahsun (garlic)-Adrak (ginger)-Dhania(coriander) in liberal quantities in my mutton curry.The hiring company wants a Data Architect of SAP vintage. Esp. expert in Supply Chain Planning. The engagement manager added 10 more lines of JD.PS: I never used any project management tool. It's a nuisance for me. I do my project management on notepad. The only project management tool I know. The other tool I know is email.Advice to recruiters: Stick to the CORE. Why do you need someone like me? What is the context of hiring? Ask for a quote.

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Kapil BodhareKapil Bodhare,,"𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 1𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚:I have been wondering how many possible ways in which we can reverse a given string in Java. Answer is 7. Amazing ? Check out below:1.

𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 (𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭)public class ReverseStringBuilderLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { reversed.append(str.charAt(i)); // StringBuilder is mutable } System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed.toString()); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:Time Complexity: O(n) (only one pass is made).Space Complexity: O(n) (since we store the reversed string).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅ Recommended over String concatenation (+=) because StringBuilder is mutable & efficient.3. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫.𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞() (𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡)public class ReverseStringBuilderMethod { public static void main(String[] args) { String str = ""Hello""; String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); System.out.println(""Reversed String: "" + reversed); }}𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:⏲️Complexity: O(n) (StringBuilder.reverse() iterates through the string once).🌌Complexity: O(n) (because a new string is created).𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲:✅✅ Best and simplest approach for reversing a string in Java.4.

Block DigitalBlock Digital,,"Does Remote Work Really Work? 📍 Inspired by Lottie Unwin (she/her) (founder of Up World)’s viral post: https://lnkd.in/dp7b3rxc.🫢 At a recent conference, a founder shared that remote work makes managing his team easier, including making tough decisions like layoffs. But what about the darker side of remote work—bullying and loneliness?👉 61.5% of remote workers have experienced or observed bullying, reports the Workplace Bullying Institute. From 19% in 2019, workplace bullying incidents rose to 30% in 2021.👉 The U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has labeled loneliness as a significant public health risk, almost at epidemic levels. In fact, 30% of remote workers feel lonely, a higher rate than those in traditional office settings.‼️ Additionally, 73% of U.S. respondents feel technology increases their sense of isolation.At Block Digital, we recognize:- Remote work has increased both workplace bullying and loneliness.- It's here to stay and played a crucial role during COVID-19.- The digital workspace requires the same respect as physical offices.However, we ask: if you wouldn’t do or say it in an office, why say it over Slack? At Block Digital, we’re committed to building a hybrid culture rooted in empathy, and the idea that we are “humans first and professionals second.” We look forward to sharing our culture journey with you all!hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#workculture hashtag#remote

Loknath Rao (Lok)Loknath Rao (Lok),,"""You should be skilled in Jira""What does Jira mean? I responded I like Jira (cumin)-Lahsun (garlic)-Adrak (ginger)-Dhania(coriander) in liberal quantities in my mutton curry.The hiring company wants a Data Architect of SAP vintage. Esp. expert in Supply Chain Planning. The engagement manager added 10 more lines of JD.PS: I never used any project management tool. It's a nuisance for me. I do my project management on notepad. The only project management tool I know. The other tool I know is email.Advice to recruiters: Stick to the CORE. Why do you need someone like me? What is the context of hiring? Ask for a quote. Time and Material is a total fraud. I can be onboard for just 2 samosas and 3 teas a day if you are sensitized. I will pay for my own airfare.

Iryna DolynaIryna Dolyna,,"Is remote work truly more productive? 💻  The answer isn’t straightforward and may depend on several factors, including the types of tasks workers perform, available technologies, home environment, worker motivation, and management practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, industries with a higher percentage of remote workers from 2019 to 2024 saw greater productivity growth, even after accounting for pre-pandemic trends 🚀 The key reason is cost efficiency: unit costs, particularly non-labor costs, increased less in industries where remote work was more prevalent. As a result, businesses saw productivity gains despite shifting work models.Moreover, Harvard Business Review’s randomized studies reveal that remote work reduces job turnover by 35%, as it enhances job satisfaction through greater flexibility and the elimination of long commutes 🏡 .At the same time, it would be fair to also note the downsides of remote work. Isolation and disconnection from workplace culture can leave employees feeling detached, missing out on spontaneous coffee break chats and relationship-building 👩‍💻 Additionally, when employees are working from home, then the home becomes the workplace, which blurs the lines between professional and private lives.What are the biggest advantages and challenges you've faced while working remotely? Feel free to opine below👇In the picture, me working from home with my dear parrot 😊
