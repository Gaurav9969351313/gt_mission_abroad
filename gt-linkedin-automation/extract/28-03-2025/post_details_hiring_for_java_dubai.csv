Masood SafiMasood Safi,,"Spirit of Ramdan !! 🌙🎊💡🌟🕌🕋📿(Blast from past 2016 - Dubai )The spirit of the holy month of Ramadan—patience, generosity, and self-discipline—truly shines when it extends beyond personal practice into our daily lives, including the workplace. I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential.

It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits.

Syed Kazim RizviSyed Kazim Rizvi,,"The launch of the new Dirham symbol marks a significant milestone in the UAE’s economic and cultural journey. This new symbol reflects the nation’s growth, identity, and aspirations on the global stage. The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Syed Kazim RizviSyed Kazim Rizvi,,"The launch of the new Dirham symbol marks a significant milestone in the UAE’s economic and cultural journey. This new symbol reflects the nation’s growth, identity, and aspirations on the global stage. The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Masood SafiMasood Safi,,"Spirit of Ramdan !! 🌙🎊💡🌟🕌🕋📿(Blast from past 2016 - Dubai )The spirit of the holy month of Ramadan—patience, generosity, and self-discipline—truly shines when it extends beyond personal practice into our daily lives, including the workplace. I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce.

Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

This new symbol reflects the nation’s growth, identity, and aspirations on the global stage. The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

Masood SafiMasood Safi,,"Spirit of Ramdan !! 🌙🎊💡🌟🕌🕋📿(Blast from past 2016 - Dubai )The spirit of the holy month of Ramadan—patience, generosity, and self-discipline—truly shines when it extends beyond personal practice into our daily lives, including the workplace. I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce.

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce.

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

Gianpaolo PavoneGianpaolo Pavone,gianpaolo.pavone@gmail.comBROCHURE,"MORE AND MORE ITALIANS ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY TO COME TO DUBAI. WHY? The unvarnished truth? Because Italy no longer offers anything to those who really want to grow! Not even crumbs anymore! Italy, once the cradle of opportunity and growth, can no longer meet the aspirations of those who long to evolve. More and more Italians are leaving the country to seek refuge in Dubai, attracted by an economic and quality environment of excellence that promises a bright and dynamic future. Stifling bureaucracy, the burden of taxes, and economic stagnation have become insurmountable obstacles driving people to seek new frontiers. Dubai stands as a beacon of hope for those who yearn to get involved, offering a vibrant business environment full of opportunity. Here, success is not hampered by excuses or institutional barriers; all it takes is the will and the right mindset to achieve ambitious goals. The city is a crossroads for professional growth, with booming sectors such as technology, finance and tourism offering international partnerships and lightning-fast careers.One of Dubai's main advantages is the absence of personal income taxes, allowing people to enjoy tax-free salaries and greater ability to save and manage resources. The quality of life is high, with state-of-the-art infrastructure and a wide range of recreational and cultural activities that enrich the daily experience.Contrary to what you may think, Dubai is NOT a rigid and oppressive city. Nightlife is vibrant and sophisticated, with exclusive clubs and parties that far exceed those offered in Italy. Those with the means can access a world of possibilities, where respect for rules is paramount but does not limit the fun. In Italy, on the contrary, nightlife can be monotonous and uninspiring, with evenings often reduced to mere moments of leisure without any particular excitement.Of course Italy offers forever a very rich cultural heritage, a strong sense of community, wonderful landscapes, is ideal for those who appreciate tradition and stability, but apparently ..this is really not enough anymore! Indeed, it is no coincidence that Dubai represents a bold, growing choice for those who are tired of Italian “limitations,” just to use a euphemism, and wish to live in an environment that rewards ambition, resourcefulness, and high quality of life. 📩 Send us a private message today for exclusive information, expert insights and investment strategies tailored to your goals!

I have witnessed this beautifully in Dubai’s multicultural environment, where not only Muslims but also colleagues from different faiths embrace the essence of Ramadan. They express their respect and participation by decorating their workplaces in unique ways, fostering an atmosphere of inclusivity and harmony.This wonderful initiative was led by our HR as part of an employee engagement program, emphasizing human values and cultural appreciation rather than viewing employees merely as a workforce. Such efforts create a more connected and empathetic work environment, where diversity is celebrated, and mutual respect thrives.hashtag#valueshashtag#innovatehashtag#multiculturehashtag#spritofRamdanemaratech

Qazi Fakhar RehmanQazi Fakhar Rehman,,"Burj Al Arab: The Myth of the 7-Star Hotel.Dubai’s Burj Al Arab is often called the world’s first 7-star hotel, but in reality, no official hotel rating system exceeds 5 stars. Even the most prestigious luxury brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Aman Resorts, and Waldorf Astoria are officially rated only up to 5 stars.So, where did the 7-star legend come from? A British journalist attending the hotel’s launch in 1999 was so blown away by its unmatched luxury that they described it as “a 7-star hotel,” and the phrase became part of its identity.Q: What Makes Burj Al Arab One of the Most Luxurious Hotels in the World?Even without an official 7-star ranking, Burj Al Arab offers a hospitality experience beyond imagination:All 202 suites are duplexes : The smallest suite is 170 sqm (1,830 sqft), nearly four times the size of a standard 5-star hotel room. The largest is 780 sqm (8,400 sqft).24/7 personal butler service : Every suite comes with a dedicated butler, ensuring guests experience the pinnacle of luxury hospitality.Gold-plated interiors : Over 1,790 square meters of 24-karat gold leaf covers the hotel’s interiors, and even the iPads in guest rooms are gold-plated.Arrival in style : Guests can choose between a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Phantom or a private helicopter transfer, landing on the famous cantilevered helipad on the 59th floor.Underwater dining experience : The Al Mahara restaurant gives the illusion of dining under the sea, featuring a floor-to-ceiling aquarium.Sky-high luxury : The two-story Royal Suite features a rotating canopy bed, a private cinema, and a grand staircase made of gold and marble.hashtag#BurjAlArabhashtag#JumeirahHotelshashtag#JumeirahGrouphashtag#DubaiLuxuryhashtag#DubaiHotelshashtag#JumeirahExperiences

This new symbol reflects the nation’s growth, identity, and aspirations on the global stage. The Dirham, which has been the backbone of the UAE’s economy for decades, now has a visual representation that aligns with its modern, forward-thinking economy.The design is sleek and contemporary, blending traditional Arabic calligraphy with a modern aesthetic that symbolizes the UAE’s blend of heritage and innovation. This symbol will not only enhance the UAE’s global recognition but also strengthen its presence in international markets.With this move, the UAE joins a select group of nations that have a dedicated currency symbol, further emphasizing the importance of the Dirham in the global financial landscape. It will undoubtedly become a key element in branding, marketing, and trade.As we witness the Dirham’s journey into a new era, this symbol represents more than just a currency; it signifies the UAE’s growing influence and commitment to shaping the future of global finance.hashtag#UAE hashtag#DirhamSymbol hashtag#Innovation hashtag#CurrencyDesign hashtag#Economy hashtag#Branding hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#GlobalFinance

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Malte KarstanMalte Karstan,,"The Full Story of the Dubai Chocolate Phenomenon - where does it come from?Origins and First MentionThe origins of Dubai chocolate trace back to 2021, when British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier in Dubai, created a chocolate bar filled with knafeh and pistachio. This combination of milk chocolate, sweet pistachio cream, and crispy knafeh pieces—branded as “Can’t Get Knafeh of It”—quickly became a local favorite.Social Media Takes OverThe international breakthrough came in 2024 when TikTok influencers started promoting the chocolate. Its unique flavor profile and visual appeal led to viral videos garnering millions of views, dramatically increasing demand across global markets.Introduction to the European Market and Lidl UK SuccessDriven by growing interest, European retailers began adding Dubai chocolate to their offerings. In the UK, Lidl introduced its own version under the J.D. Gross private label in 2025. The initial launch via TikTok Shop was a runaway success: 6,000 bars were sold within 84 minutes. In response to this overwhelming demand, Lidl announced that the chocolate would be rolled out to physical stores nationwide on March 29, 2025.Legal Disputes and Trademark IssuesWith rising popularity came legal disputes: •	Geographical Origin Misrepresentation:In December 2024, the German importer Alina Wilmers Verwaltungs GmbH issued cease-and-desist letters to various manufacturers, including Lindt and Lidl. The claim was that using the term “Dubai chocolate” was misleading when the products were not actually produced in Dubai. The Cologne Regional Court agreed in certain cases, ruling that such branding could indeed mislead consumers. •	Trademark Disputes:There were also attempts to trademark the term “Dubai chocolate.” However, arguments were raised that the phrase had become generic, referring to a specific type of recipe, and thus could not be exclusively protected.Recent Developments and CriticismDespite legal and labeling controversies, Dubai chocolate remains a top seller. Some retailers were forced to limit purchase quantities due to high demand—for example, Waitrose in the UK restricted sales to two bars per customer.At the same time, health and quality concerns emerged: In December 2024, food safety authorities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, examined imported Dubai chocolate bars and found that some contained palm oil instead of cocoa butter, along with contaminants that posed potential health risks.ConclusionThe story of Dubai chocolate is a striking example of how a niche local product can rise to global fame through social media virality and clever branding. Despite legal battles and quality issues, it remains a symbol of how fast-moving consumer trends are shaped today—and a reminder of the importance of authenticity, transparency, and product integrity in the food industry.

Joseph Mbi A.Joseph Mbi A.,,"10 Harsh Truths About Dubai’s Job Market You Should Know Before MovingIf you are not a Specialist or Senior in the C Level Category, Be Ready for AnythingUnless you're an IT expert, a highly skilled specialist, or a senior C Level, your first job in Dubai might not match your qualifications. Many newcomers end up taking whatever job they can find just to survive.Connections Matter More Than Your CVIt’s not just about your skills—who you know plays a huge role in landing a job. Networking is everything, and referrals often carry more weight than experience.Your Nationality Can Affect Your SalarySalaries aren’t always based on skills or experience. Many companies offer different pay scales based on nationality and what you were earning before moving to Dubai.Salary Delays & Passport Confiscation Still HappenEven though it's illegal, some employers still hold passports, and salary delays are common in most industries and companies. Always research a company before accepting a job.Your Job Title Might Not Match Your RoleA ""Manager"" title doesn’t always mean you’ll be managing. Many roles come with extra tasks that weren’t mentioned in the job description, and you’ll often be expected to do much more than what’s in your contract.Dubai is Expensive—Your First Salary Might Not Be EnoughHigh rent, transportation costs, and living expenses can eat up your salary fast. If you don’t negotiate well, you might struggle to save anything at the end of the month.Job Security is UnpredictableLayoffs happen without warning, and many contracts favor the employer. If you lose your job, you only have 30-60 days to find another before your visa expires.Not All Companies Offer Career GrowthSome companies promote quickly, while others keep employees in the same role for years. Don't expect automatic promotions—career growth depends on your company, and your network within the company,  not just your hard work.Getting Your First Job is the Hardest Part.Dubai employers often prefer candidates with local experience. If you’re new, expect a tough job hunt, and be ready to prove yourself before getting a good offer.The Job Market Changes FastSome industries are booming today but can decline just as quickly. If you're in real estate, tourism, or finance, for example, job stability depends on market trends.Would you still move to Dubai for work? Let’s hear your thoughts.

Gianpaolo PavoneGianpaolo Pavone,gianpaolo.pavone@gmail.comBROCHURE,"MORE AND MORE ITALIANS ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY TO COME TO DUBAI. WHY? The unvarnished truth? Because Italy no longer offers anything to those who really want to grow! Not even crumbs anymore! Italy, once the cradle of opportunity and growth, can no longer meet the aspirations of those who long to evolve. More and more Italians are leaving the country to seek refuge in Dubai, attracted by an economic and quality environment of excellence that promises a bright and dynamic future. Stifling bureaucracy, the burden of taxes, and economic stagnation have become insurmountable obstacles driving people to seek new frontiers. Dubai stands as a beacon of hope for those who yearn to get involved, offering a vibrant business environment full of opportunity. Here, success is not hampered by excuses or institutional barriers; all it takes is the will and the right mindset to achieve ambitious goals. The city is a crossroads for professional growth, with booming sectors such as technology, finance and tourism offering international partnerships and lightning-fast careers.One of Dubai's main advantages is the absence of personal income taxes, allowing people to enjoy tax-free salaries and greater ability to save and manage resources. The quality of life is high, with state-of-the-art infrastructure and a wide range of recreational and cultural activities that enrich the daily experience.Contrary to what you may think, Dubai is NOT a rigid and oppressive city. Nightlife is vibrant and sophisticated, with exclusive clubs and parties that far exceed those offered in Italy. Those with the means can access a world of possibilities, where respect for rules is paramount but does not limit the fun. In Italy, on the contrary, nightlife can be monotonous and uninspiring, with evenings often reduced to mere moments of leisure without any particular excitement.Of course Italy offers forever a very rich cultural heritage, a strong sense of community, wonderful landscapes, is ideal for those who appreciate tradition and stability, but apparently ..this is really not enough anymore! Indeed, it is no coincidence that Dubai represents a bold, growing choice for those who are tired of Italian “limitations,” just to use a euphemism, and wish to live in an environment that rewards ambition, resourcefulness, and high quality of life. 📩 Send us a private message today for exclusive information, expert insights and investment strategies tailored to your goals!
