Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

I was invited to present what we Balfour Beatty plc are doing to attract future hashtag#Apprentices in to hashtag#BalfourBeatty. The slide which got the most discussion was the second image attached. The pathway to be a recognised professional.

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

I was invited to present what we Balfour Beatty plc are doing to attract future hashtag#Apprentices in to hashtag#BalfourBeatty. The slide which got the most discussion was the second image attached.

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures.

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits. If we worked together in the past and you'd like to write me a recommendation here on LinkedIn, please do! Every bit of support helps. And if you're also out there looking, know that you're not alone. Feel free to reach out for support. We're all stronger together, after all.

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures.

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits. If we worked together in the past and you'd like to write me a recommendation here on LinkedIn, please do! Every bit of support helps. And if you're also out there looking, know that you're not alone. Feel free to reach out for support. We're all stronger together, after all.

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures.

I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits. If we worked together in the past and you'd like to write me a recommendation here on LinkedIn, please do! Every bit of support helps. And if you're also out there looking, know that you're not alone. Feel free to reach out for support. We're all stronger together, after all. Thanks again for listening and for any support you can provide. Y'all are why this job search is so much less stressful than the last. I didn't have a strong network when I left law so thank you for being you and for being here. 💜

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures.

Guillermo Garcia-CavazosGuillermo Garcia-Cavazos,,"🚨 Radiopharma is racing against the clock—literally.In my conversations this week with VPs and Heads of Quality at radiopharma companies, one thing keeps coming up: the logistics are a nightmare.The short half-lives of many therapies, including detergents, make it incredibly challenging to deliver them to patients in a timely manner.

Shiho ToyoshimaShiho Toyoshima,,"【2024年度QBICプログラム「キャリアと実践Ⅰ 」に学生メンターとして参加】2025年2月8日、QBICプログラムが提供する「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」の最終発表会が行われました。QBICプログラム(Question-Based Innovation and Career education program for societal transition)は、転換期の社会に求められる力を培うための産学速型教育プログラムです。「キャリアと実践Ⅰ」は、本プログラムの科目の一つであり、大阪公立大学の学生が、異なる分野や学年で構成されるグループを作り、「都市大阪の20年後（2045年）の未来社会を創造し，「今」自分たちが取りくむべき課題を設定する」というテーマに取り組みます。グループには、受講生の他に、以前本プログラムを受講していた学生が学生メンターとして、さらに、パナソニックや清水建設、日立製作所、リンクアンドモチベーションなどといった、日本を代表する企業の人事の方が社会人メンターとして加わります。今回も受講生らは、自分とは異なる立場の人達と、20年後の都市大阪の未来を共創する取り組みの中で、「問いを立てる力」と、「学び続ける力」を身につけ、大きく成長させることができました。今回私は、学生メンターとして本プログラムに参加しました。受講生の先輩としてミーティング中にアドバイスしたり、社会人メンターとやりとりしたりし、非常に貴重な経験をさせていただきました。受講生の頃からこれでもかというくらい多くの知識やスキルを与えてくださった市田先生には感謝しかないです。また、本プログラムを主催している先生方や企業の方たちはお金のためにやっているのではなく、日本をよくしていこうという熱いマインドを持たれていて、非常に尊敬しました。本プログラムのさらなる拡大をお祈りしております。この春からいよいよ社会人ですが、熱い心と謙虚な姿勢で社会に価値を与えられる存在になりたいと思います！https://lnkd.in/dbk5rFhZhashtag#大阪公立大学 hashtag#QBIC hashtag#共創

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits. If we worked together in the past and you'd like to write me a recommendation here on LinkedIn, please do! Every bit of support helps. And if you're also out there looking, know that you're not alone. Feel free to reach out for support. We're all stronger together, after all. Thanks again for listening and for any support you can provide. Y'all are why this job search is so much less stressful than the last. I didn't have a strong network when I left law so thank you for being you and for being here. 💜

Guillermo Garcia-CavazosGuillermo Garcia-Cavazos,,"🚨 Radiopharma is racing against the clock—literally.In my conversations this week with VPs and Heads of Quality at radiopharma companies, one thing keeps coming up: the logistics are a nightmare.The short half-lives of many therapies, including detergents, make it incredibly challenging to deliver them to patients in a timely manner. And when you layer on complex supply chains, cross-border shipping, and cold storage, it becomes a real barrier to access.One thing people are talking about more and more is reshoring manufacturing. Whether it’s bringing production in-house or working with CDMOs, it seems like a necessary step to stay ahead of the logistical challenges.But is it feasible? What are the trade-offs?I’d love to connect with others in this space and hear how you’re thinking about these issues. Let’s share ideas, experiences, and maybe even solutions.If you’re building out teams to tackle these challenges—logistics, tech ops, QA, manufacturing—I’d love to support your hiring efforts.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Kate S.Kate S.,,"Well, I'm officially two months into my job search and for the first time finding myself with no active interview loops. I fully recognize that I'm lucky to have been through a few loops already. A lot of folks wait longer for any interviews. But, the clock is ticking and in this market it seems you can be too proactive. So I'm seizing this milestone to remind my network that I'm still hashtag#opentoworkI'm looking for remote roles such as:🛠 Sr. QA Analyst or QA Manager🤝 Customer Support Manager🎯 Customer or Test Operations ManagerMost of my experience is in tech, but I also have a legal background, including 3 years working as an attorney so I'm open to operations or technical roles within the legal field. I'd be particularly valuable at a legal tech company. I'm also open to apply my troubleshooting and defect investigation skills to pre-sales technical roles, like Solutions Engineering or Customer Success. After all, lawyers are pretty comfortable working with senior leaders.My ideal company is:🤸‍♀ Small and nimble: I don't mind wearing many hats. In fact, I thrive when no two days are alike.📖 Committed to employee learning and growth. I do my best work when I have the opportunity and resources to learn new skills and build on what I know.🤼 Focused on its customers and its people. The voice of the customer and psychological safety of my team are my north stars. I relish the opportunity to speak for those I support.🧠 Iterative and open to new ideas. Great ideas come from everywhere. Your people and your customers are an amazing resource for building great things. I love to be part of bringing those ideas to life.If I am defined by one thing, it's flexibility and an openness to new adventures. If you or someone you know is hiring and you think I'd be a good fit, let me know or feel free to refer me, even if it doesn't tick every box. I have already interviewed for a few roles I wouldn't have sought out that turned out to be great fits. If we worked together in the past and you'd like to write me a recommendation here on LinkedIn, please do! Every bit of support helps. And if you're also out there looking, know that you're not alone. Feel free to reach out for support. We're all stronger together, after all.

Guillermo Garcia-CavazosGuillermo Garcia-Cavazos,,"🚨 Radiopharma is racing against the clock—literally.In my conversations this week with VPs and Heads of Quality at radiopharma companies, one thing keeps coming up: the logistics are a nightmare.The short half-lives of many therapies, including detergents, make it incredibly challenging to deliver them to patients in a timely manner. And when you layer on complex supply chains, cross-border shipping, and cold storage, it becomes a real barrier to access.One thing people are talking about more and more is reshoring manufacturing. Whether it’s bringing production in-house or working with CDMOs, it seems like a necessary step to stay ahead of the logistical challenges.But is it feasible? What are the trade-offs?I’d love to connect with others in this space and hear how you’re thinking about these issues. Let’s share ideas, experiences, and maybe even solutions.If you’re building out teams to tackle these challenges—logistics, tech ops, QA, manufacturing—I’d love to support your hiring efforts.

Mark ForsterMark Forster,,"It’s time companies started seeing autistic people as assets, not obstacles!This is the first time I’m openly admitting that I’m autistic (Asperger) beyond my close family and friends. It’s something I’ve kept to myself for a long time because, frankly, it’s not easy. Every word you say can make you feel like an outsider, as if people see you as “weird.” So, the instinct is to hide it, to avoid declaring it, and to struggle against the pressure to conform.But my brother—who works in education and supports people with autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergences—recently said something that really stuck with me: Autism isn’t a hindrance; it’s a superpower! I was genuinely touched because, honestly, I often worry that he doesn’t see me that way.For example, when I approach a problem, I see the big picture, while many “neurotypical” people focus only on what’s right in front of them. This ability is especially valuable in programming, where structure, logic, and attention to detail are essential. Autistic people often excel in programming and technical fields because of their ability to spot patterns, think systematically, and work with incredible focus.But what’s frustrating is when others can’t see the big picture and block progress because they’re stuck on minor details or rigid ways of thinking. It’s exhausting to have a clear vision of how things should work, only to be told, “That’s not how we do it,” by people who refuse to see beyond their own limited perspective. This is one of the biggest challenges autistic people face in the workplace—not our abilities, but the barriers put in our way by those who don’t understand them.Some companies fail to see the value in this. But the best ones do, and they recognise the incredible strengths that autistic minds bring.This conversation has really lifted my spirits. I love seeing more people acknowledge that autistic individuals have so much to offer when given the right environment to thrive—especially in fields like programming, where our strengths shine!Well done Murphy for setting a new standard!

Michelle LarsonMichelle Larson,,"A gentle bit of perspective from a recruiter with a lot of things on her plate: Internal recruiters work for companies, not candidates. We are paid by employers who have hired us to fill specific roles to help the company grow/do awesome stuff/make money. While a lot of us love our candidates, and applicants in general, our focus is on the work in front of us. As an example, I'm working on a lot of roles lately for our QA Engineering teams. My companies pays for me to fill those roles. If I can forward some relevant leads for other positions to help my fellow recruiters or other teams at the company, that's awesome! But the focus for me is to work on those QAE roles, which are my priority now.*If you're looking for a new job and you know a recruiter at a company where you think you'd like to work, please say something - but also do a little digging first. Find out what roles are open that might be relevant to you. Poke around on the company's job board and website to learn the most basic stuff about what the company is doing, and what their culture might be like. Recruiters are happy to help out candidates, friends, acquaintances (Especially if you bribe us with pictures of cute animals.**): but it's a lot easier if you put in the work first. Show us you looked at our website and our job listings. Ask us about specific jobs! Please try to avoid handing us your profile or a resume and making us dig to find a relevant role for you. Even if we want to help, we don't often have the time (because work is paying us to fill very specific roles - not necessarily ones you can fill), and we don't know you/what you want to do/what you're good at as well as you do. :) * Seriously, our EOSH team is hiring! https://lnkd.in/grVQi_Yp** Yes, this is an invitation for you to post animal pictures. Heaven knows we need more cute in our feeds! :D

Guillermo Garcia-CavazosGuillermo Garcia-Cavazos,,"🚨 Radiopharma is racing against the clock—literally.In my conversations this week with VPs and Heads of Quality at radiopharma companies, one thing keeps coming up: the logistics are a nightmare.The short half-lives of many therapies, including detergents, make it incredibly challenging to deliver them to patients in a timely manner. And when you layer on complex supply chains, cross-border shipping, and cold storage, it becomes a real barrier to access.One thing people are talking about more and more is reshoring manufacturing. Whether it’s bringing production in-house or working with CDMOs, it seems like a necessary step to stay ahead of the logistical challenges.But is it feasible? What are the trade-offs?I’d love to connect with others in this space and hear how you’re thinking about these issues. Let’s share ideas, experiences, and maybe even solutions.If you’re building out teams to tackle these challenges—logistics, tech ops, QA, manufacturing—I’d love to support your hiring efforts.
