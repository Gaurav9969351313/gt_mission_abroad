Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Gary E. SmithGary E. Smith,,"Majority Of Canadians say refugees receive too many benefits A growing number of Canadians believe refugees and asylum seekers receive excessive government benefits, according to internal research by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Blacklock's Reporter says the findings align with a decline in public support for high immigration levels, as documented by the Department of Immigration.A report titled Foresights For Human Rights: 2024 Preliminary Reportfound that 56% of respondents felt refugees and asylum seekers were granted too many benefits. Additionally, 41% believed there was too much emphasis on newcomers’ rights.Public sentiment about immigration’s impact has shifted significantly. When asked if “immigrants make the country better,” only 44% agreed, down from 52% the previous year. The report noted a growing perception that immigration is linked to economic strain. “More research is needed to understand the roots of this trend,” it stated.The study also found that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement: “Refugee applicants receive too many benefits that would be better used by Canadians.”Read Article:https://lnkd.in/dauksgKchashtag#Opines on hashtag#CanadianPolitics hashtag#CanadianImmigrationhashtag#STOPMASSIMMIGRATIONhashtag#CanadianOpiner by hashtag#OpineMediaGroup

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Additionally, 41% believed there was too much emphasis on newcomers’ rights.Public sentiment about immigration’s impact has shifted significantly. When asked if “immigrants make the country better,” only 44% agreed, down from 52% the previous year. The report noted a growing perception that immigration is linked to economic strain. “More research is needed to understand the roots of this trend,” it stated.The study also found that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement: “Refugee applicants receive too many benefits that would be better used by Canadians.”Read Article:https://lnkd.in/dauksgKchashtag#Opines on hashtag#CanadianPolitics hashtag#CanadianImmigrationhashtag#STOPMASSIMMIGRATIONhashtag#CanadianOpiner by hashtag#OpineMediaGroup

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level. And of course, new job, new swag! 😊We're hiring!

Gary E. SmithGary E. Smith,,"Majority Of Canadians say refugees receive too many benefits A growing number of Canadians believe refugees and asylum seekers receive excessive government benefits, according to internal research by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Blacklock's Reporter says the findings align with a decline in public support for high immigration levels, as documented by the Department of Immigration.A report titled Foresights For Human Rights: 2024 Preliminary Reportfound that 56% of respondents felt refugees and asylum seekers were granted too many benefits. Additionally, 41% believed there was too much emphasis on newcomers’ rights.Public sentiment about immigration’s impact has shifted significantly. When asked if “immigrants make the country better,” only 44% agreed, down from 52% the previous year. The report noted a growing perception that immigration is linked to economic strain. “More research is needed to understand the roots of this trend,” it stated.The study also found that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement: “Refugee applicants receive too many benefits that would be better used by Canadians.”Read Article:https://lnkd.in/dauksgKchashtag#Opines on hashtag#CanadianPolitics hashtag#CanadianImmigrationhashtag#STOPMASSIMMIGRATIONhashtag#CanadianOpiner by hashtag#OpineMediaGroup

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Gary E. SmithGary E. Smith,,"Majority Of Canadians say refugees receive too many benefits A growing number of Canadians believe refugees and asylum seekers receive excessive government benefits, according to internal research by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Blacklock's Reporter says the findings align with a decline in public support for high immigration levels, as documented by the Department of Immigration.A report titled Foresights For Human Rights: 2024 Preliminary Reportfound that 56% of respondents felt refugees and asylum seekers were granted too many benefits. Additionally, 41% believed there was too much emphasis on newcomers’ rights.Public sentiment about immigration’s impact has shifted significantly. When asked if “immigrants make the country better,” only 44% agreed, down from 52% the previous year. The report noted a growing perception that immigration is linked to economic strain. “More research is needed to understand the roots of this trend,” it stated.The study also found that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement: “Refugee applicants receive too many benefits that would be better used by Canadians.”Read Article:https://lnkd.in/dauksgKchashtag#Opines on hashtag#CanadianPolitics hashtag#CanadianImmigrationhashtag#STOPMASSIMMIGRATIONhashtag#CanadianOpiner by hashtag#OpineMediaGroup

Khac LeKhac Le,,"It’s been an exciting first month at Chorus—diving into QA processes, automation, and tackling new challenges. One big takeaway so far: low-code test automation just doesn’t cut it for the long haul.Tools like Mabl are easy to start with, but they come with their fair share of issues—brittle tests, poor debugging, and a gap between QA and development. Real scalability comes from flexibility, and that’s why I’m all about building a code-based automation strategy with Playwright to drive: ✅ Better collaboration between QA and developers ✅ More reliable, maintainable tests ✅ Smoother CI/CD integrationThere’s a lot of room for growth here at Chorus, and I’m pumped to help take QA automation to the next level.

Additionally, 41% believed there was too much emphasis on newcomers’ rights.Public sentiment about immigration’s impact has shifted significantly. When asked if “immigrants make the country better,” only 44% agreed, down from 52% the previous year. The report noted a growing perception that immigration is linked to economic strain. “More research is needed to understand the roots of this trend,” it stated.The study also found that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement: “Refugee applicants receive too many benefits that would be better used by Canadians.”Read Article:https://lnkd.in/dauksgKchashtag#Opines on hashtag#CanadianPolitics hashtag#CanadianImmigrationhashtag#STOPMASSIMMIGRATIONhashtag#CanadianOpiner by hashtag#OpineMediaGroup
