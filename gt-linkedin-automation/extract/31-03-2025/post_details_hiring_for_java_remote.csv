In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Ernest SakalaErnest Sakala,,"Java 24 .Programming language are evolving ,java is one of those languages.Oracle recently announced the release of Java 24 on 18 March 2024. In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Ernest SakalaErnest Sakala,,"Java 24 .Programming language are evolving ,java is one of those languages.Oracle recently announced the release of Java 24 on 18 March 2024. In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Ernest SakalaErnest Sakala,,"Java 24 .Programming language are evolving ,java is one of those languages.Oracle recently announced the release of Java 24 on 18 March 2024. In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Ernest SakalaErnest Sakala,,"Java 24 .Programming language are evolving ,java is one of those languages.Oracle recently announced the release of Java 24 on 18 March 2024. In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Abhishek SrivastavaAbhishek Srivastava,,"‚úÖ DAY 32 hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMeüì¢ Daily Schedule: üìå 11 AM ‚Äì 2-3 Coding Questions üìå 5 PM ‚Äì 3-5 Interview Questions (Testing Theory / TestNG / GitLab Basics)Let‚Äôs continue building our testing mindset with practical questions around real-world concepts in theory, TestNG, and GitLab. üí°üëá1Ô∏è‚É£ What Are Entry and Exit Criteria in Software Testing?üìå Question: What do you mean by entry and exit criteria in a test plan?‚úÖ Answer:Entry Criteria: Pre-conditions that must be met before testing begins. üëâ Examples: Test environment is ready, test cases are reviewed, code is deployed.Exit Criteria: Conditions that define when testing is complete. üëâ Examples: All test cases executed, defect rate below threshold, no critical bugs.üéØ Key Takeaway: These criteria ensure structured start and finish of test phases with clear expectations.2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is the Purpose of groups and priority in TestNG?üìå Question: How are groups and priority used in TestNG to manage test execution?‚úÖ Answer:Groups: Categorize tests logically (e.g., regression, smoke).@Test(groups = { ""smoke"" })public void loginTest() { ... }Priority: Determines the order of execution. Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Abhishek SrivastavaAbhishek Srivastava,,"‚úÖ DAY 32 hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMeüì¢ Daily Schedule: üìå 11 AM ‚Äì 2-3 Coding Questions üìå 5 PM ‚Äì 3-5 Interview Questions (Testing Theory / TestNG / GitLab Basics)Let‚Äôs continue building our testing mindset with practical questions around real-world concepts in theory, TestNG, and GitLab. üí°üëá1Ô∏è‚É£ What Are Entry and Exit Criteria in Software Testing?üìå Question: What do you mean by entry and exit criteria in a test plan?‚úÖ Answer:Entry Criteria: Pre-conditions that must be met before testing begins. üëâ Examples: Test environment is ready, test cases are reviewed, code is deployed.Exit Criteria: Conditions that define when testing is complete. üëâ Examples: All test cases executed, defect rate below threshold, no critical bugs.üéØ Key Takeaway: These criteria ensure structured start and finish of test phases with clear expectations.2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is the Purpose of groups and priority in TestNG?üìå Question: How are groups and priority used in TestNG to manage test execution?‚úÖ Answer:Groups: Categorize tests logically (e.g., regression, smoke).@Test(groups = { ""smoke"" })public void loginTest() { ... }Priority: Determines the order of execution. Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Ernest SakalaErnest Sakala,,"Java 24 .Programming language are evolving ,java is one of those languages.Oracle recently announced the release of Java 24 on 18 March 2024. In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan. I will experiment with the new features especially stream gatherers and see what they have to offer. hashtag#java24

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Anton S.Anton S.,,"üí° Runnable üÜö Callable.üëâ In Java, two main interfaces are used to represent tasks executed in separate threads: Runnable and Callable.The main differences between them are as follows:‚òëÔ∏è Return value. üîπ  Runnable: The run() method of this interface does not return a result (it has the void type). This makes it suitable for tasks where it is not required to get results after completion. üîπ Callable: The call() method returns a result of type V, which allows you to get a value after completing the task. This is especially useful when it is necessary to return the result of calculations.‚òëÔ∏è Exception handling.üîπ Runnable: The run() method cannot throw checked exceptions. If such an exception occurs during execution, it must be handled inside the run() method.üîπ Callable: The call() method can throw checked exceptions, which allows for more flexible handling of errors that occur during task execution.‚òëÔ∏è Appearance in the Java version.üîπRunnable: This was introduced in the very first version of Java (Java 1.0).üîπCallable: Introduced in Java 5.0 as part of the java.util.concurrent library to enhance multithreading capabilities.‚ÄºÔ∏è Examples:private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Application.class.getName());public static void main(String[] args) { Runnable task = () -> { logger.log(Level.INFO, ""The task is executed in a separate thread""); }; new Thread(task).start();}public static void main(String[] args) { Callable<Integer> task = () -> { return 123; }; ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1); Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task); Integer result = future.get(); executor.shutdown();}The choice between Runnable and Callable depends on the requirements of the task. If you don't want to return a result, you can use Runnable. But if you need to get the result of execution, it is preferable to use a Callable.üìî Documentation: https://lnkd.in/d-UK_Jjzhttps://lnkd.in/dv4W9KD9https://lnkd.in/dWw7DHJHhashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#ProgrammingTips

The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Anton S.Anton S.,,"üí° Runnable üÜö Callable.üëâ In Java, two main interfaces are used to represent tasks executed in separate threads: Runnable and Callable.The main differences between them are as follows:‚òëÔ∏è Return value. üîπ  Runnable: The run() method of this interface does not return a result (it has the void type). This makes it suitable for tasks where it is not required to get results after completion. üîπ Callable: The call() method returns a result of type V, which allows you to get a value after completing the task. This is especially useful when it is necessary to return the result of calculations.‚òëÔ∏è Exception handling.üîπ Runnable: The run() method cannot throw checked exceptions. If such an exception occurs during execution, it must be handled inside the run() method.üîπ Callable: The call() method can throw checked exceptions, which allows for more flexible handling of errors that occur during task execution.‚òëÔ∏è Appearance in the Java version.üîπRunnable: This was introduced in the very first version of Java (Java 1.0).üîπCallable: Introduced in Java 5.0 as part of the java.util.concurrent library to enhance multithreading capabilities.‚ÄºÔ∏è Examples:private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Application.class.getName());public static void main(String[] args) { Runnable task = () -> { logger.log(Level.INFO, ""The task is executed in a separate thread""); }; new Thread(task).start();}public static void main(String[] args) { Callable<Integer> task = () -> { return 123; }; ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1); Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task); Integer result = future.get(); executor.shutdown();}The choice between Runnable and Callable depends on the requirements of the task. If you don't want to return a result, you can use Runnable. But if you need to get the result of execution, it is preferable to use a Callable.üìî Documentation: https://lnkd.in/d-UK_Jjzhttps://lnkd.in/dv4W9KD9https://lnkd.in/dWw7DHJHhashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#ProgrammingTips

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Abhishek SrivastavaAbhishek Srivastava,,"‚úÖ DAY 32 hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMeüì¢ Daily Schedule: üìå 11 AM ‚Äì 2-3 Coding Questions üìå 5 PM ‚Äì 3-5 Interview Questions (Testing Theory / TestNG / GitLab Basics)Let‚Äôs continue building our testing mindset with practical questions around real-world concepts in theory, TestNG, and GitLab. üí°üëá1Ô∏è‚É£ What Are Entry and Exit Criteria in Software Testing?üìå Question: What do you mean by entry and exit criteria in a test plan?‚úÖ Answer:Entry Criteria: Pre-conditions that must be met before testing begins. üëâ Examples: Test environment is ready, test cases are reviewed, code is deployed.Exit Criteria: Conditions that define when testing is complete. üëâ Examples: All test cases executed, defect rate below threshold, no critical bugs.üéØ Key Takeaway: These criteria ensure structured start and finish of test phases with clear expectations.2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is the Purpose of groups and priority in TestNG?üìå Question: How are groups and priority used in TestNG to manage test execution?‚úÖ Answer:Groups: Categorize tests logically (e.g., regression, smoke).@Test(groups = { ""smoke"" })public void loginTest() { ... }Priority: Determines the order of execution. Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Anton S.Anton S.,,"üí° Runnable üÜö Callable.üëâ In Java, two main interfaces are used to represent tasks executed in separate threads: Runnable and Callable.The main differences between them are as follows:‚òëÔ∏è Return value. üîπ  Runnable: The run() method of this interface does not return a result (it has the void type). This makes it suitable for tasks where it is not required to get results after completion. üîπ Callable: The call() method returns a result of type V, which allows you to get a value after completing the task. This is especially useful when it is necessary to return the result of calculations.‚òëÔ∏è Exception handling.üîπ Runnable: The run() method cannot throw checked exceptions. If such an exception occurs during execution, it must be handled inside the run() method.üîπ Callable: The call() method can throw checked exceptions, which allows for more flexible handling of errors that occur during task execution.‚òëÔ∏è Appearance in the Java version.üîπRunnable: This was introduced in the very first version of Java (Java 1.0).üîπCallable: Introduced in Java 5.0 as part of the java.util.concurrent library to enhance multithreading capabilities.‚ÄºÔ∏è Examples:private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Application.class.getName());public static void main(String[] args) { Runnable task = () -> { logger.log(Level.INFO, ""The task is executed in a separate thread""); }; new Thread(task).start();}public static void main(String[] args) { Callable<Integer> task = () -> { return 123; }; ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1); Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task); Integer result = future.get(); executor.shutdown();}The choice between Runnable and Callable depends on the requirements of the task. If you don't want to return a result, you can use Runnable. But if you need to get the result of execution, it is preferable to use a Callable.üìî Documentation: https://lnkd.in/d-UK_Jjzhttps://lnkd.in/dv4W9KD9https://lnkd.in/dWw7DHJHhashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#ProgrammingTips

Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .Kobus Kleyn CFP¬Æ .,,"Your Office Should Go Where You Go!At some point, I stopped thinking of travel as something that disrupts my work. Now, I see it as an extension of how I work. Christa and I work remotely around 150 days a year‚Äîon average. That is not a gimmick. That is half the year living our life, running my practice, and serving clients while on the move. When I pack my bags, I pack my office too. Not in a dramatic way‚Äîjust with intention. A few reliable tools, a simple routine, and a mindset that work and life are meant to live side by side.This is what works for us:I always stay connected. I carry a power bank and a small UPS because I have had enough surprise power cuts to know better. I also use eSIMs or grab a local SIM wherever I land. It keeps me online without burning through data costs. It is a simple way to stay available for clients, even if I am sitting on a deck somewhere with birdsong in the background.I do not leave comfort to chance. I pack foldable laptop sreens, webcam, and proper headphones. That is it. It turns any space into a workspace. I have worked from a wooden table in the Karoo, a balcony in Spain, even from the my bakkie once. It is not always glamorous, but it works. Routine matters. I keep my mornings focused and leave space in the afternoons for exploring. That rhythm keeps me grounded no matter where I am. The bonus? Some of my best ideas come during those long walks in nature , on the beach or sitting next a river like this week.Then there is Christa Kleyn Fine Artist ‚Äîshe has an eye for those little travel wins. While I am working out Wi-Fi strength, she is finding hidden gems like off-season deals, spa packages, and local long stays. She makes the adventure possible without letting it drain the budget.This lifestyle is not about being on the move all the time. It is about having the option. And being ready when the option comes. No play, no work.hashtag#workingfromanywherehashtag#proudlysouthafricanhashtag#balancinglifeandwork

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences‚úÖ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.‚úÖ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?üîπ Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.üîπ Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What‚Äôs your approach when designing Java applications?

Lower priority runs first.@Test(priority = 1)public void createUser() { ... }üéØ Key Takeaway: Use groups for test organization and priority for execution control.3Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Merge Request in GitLab?üìå Question: How does a merge request differ from a push in GitLab?‚úÖ Answer:Push: Directly sends your code to the remote branch.Merge Request (MR): A collaborative review before merging code into the main branch. üëâ MRs include code review, CI checks, and approvals.üéØ Key Takeaway: Merge requests improve code quality and reduce defects through collaboration.4Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Smoke vs Sanity Testing?üìå Question: How is smoke testing different from sanity testing?‚úÖ Answer:Smoke Testing: Basic health check to ensure the build is stable. üëâ Example: App launches, main pages load.Sanity Testing: Quick test of specific functionality after minor changes. üëâ Example: Verifying just the login module after a login bug fix.üéØ Key Takeaway: Smoke = Build verification. Sanity = Bug fix validation.Final Thoughtsüîπ Testing is not just about writing code ‚Äî it's about understanding when to test, what to test, and how to manage quality in teams using tools like TestNG and GitLab. üîπ Keep mastering the foundation ‚Äî it sets the stage for scalable automation.hashtag#SDET hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#TestNG hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#GitLab hashtag#TestingTheory hashtag#QA hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#hiring hashtag#jobs hashtag#90DaysOfAutomationWithMe hashtag#Java hashtag#Interview

Anton S.Anton S.,,"üí° Runnable üÜö Callable.üëâ In Java, two main interfaces are used to represent tasks executed in separate threads: Runnable and Callable.The main differences between them are as follows:‚òëÔ∏è Return value. üîπ  Runnable: The run() method of this interface does not return a result (it has the void type). This makes it suitable for tasks where it is not required to get results after completion. üîπ Callable: The call() method returns a result of type V, which allows you to get a value after completing the task. This is especially useful when it is necessary to return the result of calculations.‚òëÔ∏è Exception handling.üîπ Runnable: The run() method cannot throw checked exceptions. If such an exception occurs during execution, it must be handled inside the run() method.üîπ Callable: The call() method can throw checked exceptions, which allows for more flexible handling of errors that occur during task execution.‚òëÔ∏è Appearance in the Java version.üîπRunnable: This was introduced in the very first version of Java (Java 1.0).üîπCallable: Introduced in Java 5.0 as part of the java.util.concurrent library to enhance multithreading capabilities.‚ÄºÔ∏è Examples:private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Application.class.getName());public static void main(String[] args) { Runnable task = () -> { logger.log(Level.INFO, ""The task is executed in a separate thread""); }; new Thread(task).start();}public static void main(String[] args) { Callable<Integer> task = () -> { return 123; }; ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1); Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task); Integer result = future.get(); executor.shutdown();}The choice between Runnable and Callable depends on the requirements of the task. If you don't want to return a result, you can use Runnable. But if you need to get the result of execution, it is preferable to use a Callable.üìî Documentation: https://lnkd.in/d-UK_Jjzhttps://lnkd.in/dv4W9KD9https://lnkd.in/dWw7DHJHhashtag#Java hashtag#Programming hashtag#ProgrammingTips
