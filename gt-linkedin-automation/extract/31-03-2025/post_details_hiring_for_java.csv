Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Liza HandsLiza Hands,,"I asked ChatGPT to roast me 🤣You run Hands on Recruitment, but let’s be real—the only thing you’ve got your hands on is your head in frustration because candidates don’t read job descriptions properly. You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Liza HandsLiza Hands,,"I asked ChatGPT to roast me 🤣You run Hands on Recruitment, but let’s be real—the only thing you’ve got your hands on is your head in frustration because candidates don’t read job descriptions properly. You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

In as much as the language is evolving, it will take time for the Java Community to trust Oracle with the gimmick they pulled over licencing. The java community has not really moved away from java 8 . Most enterprise systems are still using Java 8. Let's wait and see what oracle will do with language. I am still a big java fan.

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment?

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications?

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Lakin MohapatraLakin Mohapatra,,"Ever wondered why Go (Golang) is so efficient at handling concurrency?It's not just goroutines—the real magic lies in Go’s work-stealing scheduler.Unlike traditional thread-based concurrency models, Go's scheduler is smart—it dynamically steals work from idle processors, ensuring maximum CPU utilization and blazing-fast execution.How Go Handles Concurrency?Go doesn’t rely on OS threads the way traditional languages do. Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

You’re out here trying to match people with jobs, but half the time, you’re just playing therapist for candidates who don’t know what they want and employers who think they can get top talent for minimum wage.Oh, recruitment laughs in your face. You spend hours finding the perfect candidate, only for them to ghost you. Meanwhile, your clients expect miracles, acting like you have a secret underground lab full of dream employees just waiting for them.You love getting what you want, but let’s be honest—when’s the last time you actually got what you wanted in recruitment? A client who knows what they want? A candidate who doesn’t flake at the last minute? A hiring process that doesn’t drag on for eternity? Yeah, didn’t think so. 🤣🤣🤣

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

Sebastiaan RondhuisSebastiaan Rondhuis,,"Chefs secretThere is gold in inbound candidates.Only one catch.They need to apply.With Doghouse we’ve filled more than 30% of our roles last year with inbound candidates. Nowadays our brand and following definitely plays a part, but we’ve always attracted strong candidates with our vacancies, even when we just started out in 2015.3 crucial factors in your vacancies when hiring for technology, where I see a lot of companies still make mistakes:#1 searchableKey words for technologies are essential to show up in people’s searches. I still see roles for developer or cloud architect without specific tech stack mentioned 🤷🏼‍♂️Java developers will search for “software developer Java”, so they simply don’t find your vacancy if you don’t mention Java in it.Sound simple but I still see those vacancies.Even if you look for an agnost, or don’t care which tech they worked with (for instance with cloud), at least name the main vendor technologies to show up in searches (AWS, GCP, Azure).#2 write about the techToo many vacancies spend the majority of the vacancies on the company, culture and broad work descriptions. The tech people want to know about the bits and bites. Share some ongoing projects or innovations you try to apply. The more technical the better in my experience. Ask the technical lead for some serious input.#3 know where to postSome companies still mainly leverage their website. Whilst this works for the likes of Adyen and Miro, many smaller company websites don’t get much traffic. Post in job boards or LinkedIn instead. We get strongest quality of applicants as well as most volume still from LinkedIn.If you are not already applying this to you vacancies for hires on technology, start today! 🫵🏻Small changes can lead to big results, all you need is that one killer candidate to apply 💪🏻

Instead, it introduces:- Goroutines – Lightweight, managed by Go, not the OS.- GOMAXPROCS – Controls the number of OS threads used.- M:N Scheduling – Maps thousands of goroutines to a limited number of OS threads.Unlike Python or Java, Go’s runtime handles scheduling instead of leaving it to the OS.This is where the work-stealing algorithm shines.- How Work Stealing WorksInstead of a single queue for all tasks (which can create bottlenecks), Go’s scheduler assigns each thread (P) its own local queue.Magic happens when one thread runs out of work.- If a thread’s queue is empty, it doesn’t sit idle.- Instead, it steals tasks from another thread’s queue.- This keeps the system balanced and efficient.No thread is left waiting when there's work to be done.Go’s work-stealing approach provides:- Lower Latency – Tasks get scheduled faster without bottlenecks.- Better CPU Utilization – No cores sit idle while others are overloaded.- Scalability – Thousands (or millions) of goroutines run smoothly.For comparison: - Thread pools (like in Java) often create contention due to global queues. - Manual concurrency (like in C++) requires explicit thread management.Go automates all of this, making concurrency simple yet powerful.If you’re building high-performance, concurrent applications:- Use goroutines freely – The scheduler will optimize execution.- Avoid blocking calls – Blocking a goroutine blocks the underlying OS thread.- Tune GOMAXPROCS – Default is based on CPU cores but can be tweaked.Go’s smart scheduler + work-stealing means you get parallel performance without managing threads manually.Go’s concurrency model isn’t just about goroutines.It’s about how Go efficiently balances work across cores, ensuring no CPU cycle is wasted.- A smarter scheduler means better performance.- Work stealing ensures fairness and responsiveness.- You write simple code, and Go handles the complexity.That’s why Go is one of the best languages for scalable applications.hashtag#golang hashtag#scaling hashtag#developers hashtag#coding hashtag#vibecoding hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#Jhibli hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#mean hashtag#mern hashtag#go

Mokete AkamaMokete Akama,,"Abstract Class vs Interface in JavaWhen designing object-oriented systems in Java, choosing between abstract classes and interfaces is crucial. Both prevent direct instantiation, but they serve different purposes.Key Differences✅ Abstract Class:Can have both abstract and concrete methods.Allows instance variables.A class can extend only one abstract class.Used when classes share common state/behavior.✅ Interface:Contains only abstract methods (before Java 8).Can only have static and final variables.A class can implement multiple interfaces.Used when classes share only behavior (method signatures).When to Use What?🔹 Use abstract classes when you need shared behavior and state.🔹 Use interfaces when you need a contract that multiple classes must follow.For example, in a Vehicle system:An abstract class can define shared properties like speed and fuelType.An interface like Drivable ensures all vehicles implement accelerate() and brake().What’s your approach when designing Java applications? Let’s discuss! 🚀

I still see roles for developer or cloud architect without specific tech stack mentioned 🤷🏼‍♂️Java developers will search for “software developer Java”, so they simply don’t find your vacancy if you don’t mention Java in it.Sound simple but I still see those vacancies.Even if you look for an agnost, or don’t care which tech they worked with (for instance with cloud), at least name the main vendor technologies to show up in searches (AWS, GCP, Azure).#2 write about the techToo many vacancies spend the majority of the vacancies on the company, culture and broad work descriptions. The tech people want to know about the bits and bites. Share some ongoing projects or innovations you try to apply. The more technical the better in my experience. Ask the technical lead for some serious input.#3 know where to postSome companies still mainly leverage their website. Whilst this works for the likes of Adyen and Miro, many smaller company websites don’t get much traffic. Post in job boards or LinkedIn instead. We get strongest quality of applicants as well as most volume still from LinkedIn.If you are not already applying this to you vacancies for hires on technology, start today! 🫵🏻Small changes can lead to big results, all you need is that one killer candidate to apply 💪🏻
