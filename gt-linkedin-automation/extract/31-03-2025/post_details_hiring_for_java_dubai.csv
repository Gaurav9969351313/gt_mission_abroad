Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Fully manufactured exports, which contributed 52.1% of total merchandise exports, also grew by 8.3%.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Fully manufactured exports, which contributed 52.1% of total merchandise exports, also grew by 8.3%.

This move has the potential to drive innovation in healthcare, drug discovery, and economic diversification. However, as with any pioneering effort, careful consideration is needed to ensure ethical safeguards, data privacy, and responsible governance.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening.

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID. May Allah bless all!!!

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

This move has the potential to drive innovation in healthcare, drug discovery, and economic diversification.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID. May Allah bless all!!!

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Redbond & Co AccountantsRedbond & Co Accountants,,"I didn’t grow up celebrating Eid – but living in Dubai has taught me just how special it really is. 🌙One of the things I’ve really come to appreciate since moving to Dubai is how the city embraces all cultures, and Eid is such a brilliant example of that.Whether you’re celebrating with family, friends, or just soaking in the atmosphere, there’s something special about this time of year. Streets lit up, gifts being exchanged, and a genuine feeling of togetherness that reminds you what matters most.As someone who didn’t grow up celebrating Eid, I’ve enjoyed learning more about it since living here. It’s not just about the public holidays or the incredible food (although that definitely helps 😄) it’s a time that brings people closer. A chance to reset, spend time with loved ones, and reflect on the year so far.For us as a family, it’s been another reminder of why we love living in Dubai. The way this city welcomes people from all walks of life and respects traditions from around the world is something quite unique.To all of you celebrating, Eid Mubarak! Wishing you and your loved ones peace, happiness and good health.And if you’re new to Dubai, I’d really recommend taking the time to experience how the city celebrates.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

"Hamad Yaseen Ali, Ph.D.Hamad Yaseen Ali, Ph.D.",,"Abu Dhabi’s initiative to commercialize its genetic database is a bold step that could position the UAE as a leader in biotech and precision medicine. This move has the potential to drive innovation in healthcare, drug discovery, and economic diversification. However, as with any pioneering effort, careful consideration is needed to ensure ethical safeguards, data privacy, and responsible governance. The Gulf region, including Kuwait, can learn from this approach, ensuring that genetic data is leveraged for scientific and economic advancement while maintaining public trust and regulatory integrity.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Fully manufactured exports, which contributed 52.1% of total merchandise exports, also grew by 8.3%.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms.

Arun K SrivastavaArun K Srivastava,,"If you have a keen interest in feeling what the EID means, you should visit Dubai, a city of dreams, a city of perusing your dreams, a city that can transform your dreams into reality. The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID. May Allah bless all!!!

This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.

This move has the potential to drive innovation in healthcare, drug discovery, and economic diversification.

Eisa AlraeesiEisa Alraeesi,,"The UAE’s Economy: From Pearls to Artificial IntelligenceThe UAE was never a mere barren desert swept by the winds; rather, it was a cradle of dreams woven from the depths of the sea. Men once dived in search of pearls, those natural treasures that formed the backbone of the ancient economy. In those days, wooden boats sailed across the waters of the Gulf, carrying the hopes of sailors who braved the waves with unwavering hearts. Pearling was not merely a trade but a symbol of perseverance and patience—the very foundation of life that flourished along the shores.Then came oil, bringing with it a profound transformation in the economic landscape. The earth burst forth with its black treasures, and wealth flowed in torrents, reshaping the UAE from humble coastal settlements into dazzling oases of modernity. It was not merely a change of resources but a complete revolution in vision and planning. The wheels of development turned at an unprecedented pace, transforming sand dunes into skyscrapers and wooden dhows into world-class ports welcoming ships from every corner of the globe.Yet, the UAE did not rest on the laurels of oil wealth, for its leaders understood that finite riches could not sustain a lasting future. Thus began the leap toward a knowledge-based economy. Universities and research centers were established, technological initiatives were launched, and the UAE became a hub of innovation, attracting brilliant minds and ambitious startups. The economy was no longer just about trade and commodities but evolved into an intricate ecosystem of artificial intelligence, big data, and renewable energy, where human ingenuity intertwines seamlessly with technology.Today, the UAE stands on the threshold of the future—not only as a financial and commercial powerhouse but as a global laboratory for shaping the digital economy. From smart cities to space ventures, from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology, the UAE is redefining the contours of modern economic paradigms. This is a story written with the ink of boldness and vision, where the past was never a constraint but a launchpad toward horizons once thought unimaginable.

The exchanges of gifts, the vibes of a festival, Iftar parties, the devotion to Almighty, all make them special. Whenever, Ramadan comes, my wife and me always remember Dubai. Those night markets, the unimaginable discounts on everything, that philanthropy and thousands of people gathering everyday for their Iftar at every Mosque. You will find people distributing snacks on every crossroads during Ramadan. Many a times, I brought such snacks and we had it together in the evening. I had privilege of having attended many high quality Iftar parties and believe me what differentiated them was the principle of equality.Wishing all of you a very happy & blessed EID.

Abdulghaffar HarounAbdulghaffar Haroun,,"This growth was reflected in the non-oil manufacturing sector, which achieved a positive growth rate for the third consecutive quarter, reaching 17.74% during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, when the sector recorded a contraction rate of 11.56%. This growth was driven by the reform measures taken by the state to stimulate the national economy, foremost among them reforms aimed at increasing private sector participation in economic activity. In this regard, the government introduced customs clearance facilities for raw materials and inputs in the industrial sector, leading to increased industrial production. The sector’s contribution to GDP growth rose from 1.4- percentage points in the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year to 1.9 percentage points in this quarter, within an overall growth rate of 4.3%.Furthermore, this was also reflected in export volumes, as the state's exports of semi-manufactured and fully manufactured goods recorded significant growth during the second quarter of the 2024/2025 fiscal year. Semi-manufactured exports, which accounted for 22.4% of total merchandise exports, grew by 22.7% in the second quarter of 2024/2025 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

That was the cornerstone on which Dubai's rapid development built up. 🎯 His son Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum, ruling Dubai from 1912 to 1958, continued the open and welcoming economic policies of his father. 🎯 Later during his reign Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum ceded many of the responsibilities for driving Dubai's economic growth to his son Rashid, who became ruler of Dubai in 1958, reigning until his death in 1990. 🎯 It was this son Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, also referred to as the Father of Modern Dubai, who concluded an agreement with British Imperial Airways for flights to take place through Dubai, with flights commencing in 1937. The agreement brought welcome revenue to Dubai and was the first step to establish Dubai as an international aviation hub. 👉 When you are in Dubai, take you time to visit the Saeed Al Maktoum House and the many additional exhibition venues in Al Shindagha to admire those Sheikhs' forward looking visions that you are benefiting from today.
