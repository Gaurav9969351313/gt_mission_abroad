Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Minimum.Yes, there is logic to combining Dev + Ops:Faster releasesLeaner teamsCleaner handoffsTighter feedback loopsBut DevOps was never meant to be one person doing it all.It was meant to be a collaboration model.We turned it into a mega-role.And mega-roles = mega-burnout.Here’s what happens when roles are too broad:Good people burn outProjects stallInfra breaksMorale dropsAnd top talent leaves - quietlyNot because they weren’t good enough.Because they were set up to fail.What works instead?✅ Clear roles✅ Shared load✅ Realistic expectationsYou don’t need to hire more.You need to hire smarter.I’ll say it straight as a recruiter:You don’t have a talent problem.You have a role design problem.📌 Save this if you’re scaling.♻️ Share this with a hiring manager who needs to hear it.➕ Follow for real-world hiring insights that protect your team.PS: You can’t fix burnout with snacks and yoga.Fix the job first.PPS: I’ve got a simple 3-step framework to spot hidden overload in your team.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Scaling your startup and trying to grow your dev team at the same time?It’s tough to outgrow yourself and ramp up resources quickly - especially with a million other things competing for your time.But there are easier, more cost-effective ways to scale - without all the hiring headaches.Because for startups, it’s not just about finding talent. It’s also about: •	Affording top-tier local salaries •	Attracting great talent in a hyper-competitive market •	Navigating the entire recruitment process (especially if it’s your first few hires)And the time cost? Expect to spend 40 to 80 hours on: •	Writing job specs •	Posting job ads •	Vetting resumes •	Conducting interviews •	Salary negotiations •	Background checks •	Making offers •	Onboarding •	Ongoing retentionOffshoring might seem like a shortcut - but it comes with its own risks. Can you really evaluate their comms, tech skills, reliability, or even confirm they’re not juggling three other gigs?Let’s be honest - hiring great talent in Australia is hard.And finding reliable offshore devs? Even harder.That’s where we come in.Tekkon helps startups scale their dev team without the hiring headaches!We handle recruitment, contracts, onboarding and people management - and connect you with top-tier remote devs at startup-friendly rates.Whether it’s full-stack, frontend, backend, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, UI/UX, data, or PMs - we’ve got your next hire (and tech-stack) covered.You focus on building your business. We’ll handle the tech talent.In fact, the smartest way to scale (in our humble opinion) is by blending a core local team with high-quality remote talent - something we’ve helped heaps of Aussie startups do for more than 8 years.Clients like Australian Tenders, Paperly, FinTech Australia, SpacetoCo, DiGii Social and more.Still burning hours on job ads or chasing candidates on LinkedIn?Maybe it’s time we had a chat.Or better yet - reach out to our clients and ask them what it’s like working with us.We’re ready when you are.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

It’s also about: •	Affording top-tier local salaries •	Attracting great talent in a hyper-competitive market •	Navigating the entire recruitment process (especially if it’s your first few hires)And the time cost? Expect to spend 40 to 80 hours on: •	Writing job specs •	Posting job ads •	Vetting resumes •	Conducting interviews •	Salary negotiations •	Background checks •	Making offers •	Onboarding •	Ongoing retentionOffshoring might seem like a shortcut - but it comes with its own risks. Can you really evaluate their comms, tech skills, reliability, or even confirm they’re not juggling three other gigs?Let’s be honest - hiring great talent in Australia is hard.And finding reliable offshore devs? Even harder.That’s where we come in.Tekkon helps startups scale their dev team without the hiring headaches!We handle recruitment, contracts, onboarding and people management - and connect you with top-tier remote devs at startup-friendly rates.Whether it’s full-stack, frontend, backend, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, UI/UX, data, or PMs - we’ve got your next hire (and tech-stack) covered.You focus on building your business.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Mahvish KhanMahvish Khan,,"Accenture Glitch: A 2- Year Struggle with No Resolution I have been facing an unbelievable registration issue with Accenture for the last two years - and despite my best efforts, there has been no response or resolution.Every time I try to register for job opportunities, I get the same notification ""We already have your profile in our database"" message. However, I have not been able to proceed beyond this step.To make things worse, I have raised hundreds of tickets over this period, hoping for assistance. But the response? Absolute silence. No emails, no resolutions - Just a frustrating cycle of being stuck without any support.This is not just a minor inconvenience, it's a roadblock for candidates eager to explore opportunities at Accenture. If a technical glitch has been persisting for so long without being addressed, how many other candidates are facing the same issue in silence?I am sharing this publicly in the hope that someone from Accenture's HR, Technical or support team takes notice and finally resolves this issue.If anyone in my network has experienced this, or if you know someone at Accenture who can help, please like, comment, or share this post in your network to bring attention to this ongoing problem.It's time to get this fixed.hashtag#Accenture hashtag#HiringIssues hashtag#RecruitmentGlitch hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Technicisse hashtag#CareerRoadblock hashtag#AccentureIndia

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Minimum.Yes, there is logic to combining Dev + Ops:Faster releasesLeaner teamsCleaner handoffsTighter feedback loopsBut DevOps was never meant to be one person doing it all.It was meant to be a collaboration model.We turned it into a mega-role.And mega-roles = mega-burnout.Here’s what happens when roles are too broad:Good people burn outProjects stallInfra breaksMorale dropsAnd top talent leaves - quietlyNot because they weren’t good enough.Because they were set up to fail.What works instead?✅ Clear roles✅ Shared load✅ Realistic expectationsYou don’t need to hire more.You need to hire smarter.I’ll say it straight as a recruiter:You don’t have a talent problem.You have a role design problem.📌 Save this if you’re scaling.♻️ Share this with a hiring manager who needs to hear it.➕ Follow for real-world hiring insights that protect your team.PS: You can’t fix burnout with snacks and yoga.Fix the job first.PPS: I’ve got a simple 3-step framework to spot hidden overload in your team.

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Scaling your startup and trying to grow your dev team at the same time?It’s tough to outgrow yourself and ramp up resources quickly - especially with a million other things competing for your time.But there are easier, more cost-effective ways to scale - without all the hiring headaches.Because for startups, it’s not just about finding talent. It’s also about: •	Affording top-tier local salaries •	Attracting great talent in a hyper-competitive market •	Navigating the entire recruitment process (especially if it’s your first few hires)And the time cost? Expect to spend 40 to 80 hours on: •	Writing job specs •	Posting job ads •	Vetting resumes •	Conducting interviews •	Salary negotiations •	Background checks •	Making offers •	Onboarding •	Ongoing retentionOffshoring might seem like a shortcut - but it comes with its own risks. Can you really evaluate their comms, tech skills, reliability, or even confirm they’re not juggling three other gigs?Let’s be honest - hiring great talent in Australia is hard.And finding reliable offshore devs? Even harder.That’s where we come in.Tekkon helps startups scale their dev team without the hiring headaches!We handle recruitment, contracts, onboarding and people management - and connect you with top-tier remote devs at startup-friendly rates.Whether it’s full-stack, frontend, backend, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, UI/UX, data, or PMs - we’ve got your next hire (and tech-stack) covered.You focus on building your business. We’ll handle the tech talent.In fact, the smartest way to scale (in our humble opinion) is by blending a core local team with high-quality remote talent - something we’ve helped heaps of Aussie startups do for more than 8 years.Clients like Australian Tenders, Paperly, FinTech Australia, SpacetoCo, DiGii Social and more.Still burning hours on job ads or chasing candidates on LinkedIn?Maybe it’s time we had a chat.Or better yet - reach out to our clients and ask them what it’s like working with us.We’re ready when you are.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Expect to spend 40 to 80 hours on: •	Writing job specs •	Posting job ads •	Vetting resumes •	Conducting interviews •	Salary negotiations •	Background checks •	Making offers •	Onboarding •	Ongoing retentionOffshoring might seem like a shortcut - but it comes with its own risks. Can you really evaluate their comms, tech skills, reliability, or even confirm they’re not juggling three other gigs?Let’s be honest - hiring great talent in Australia is hard.And finding reliable offshore devs? Even harder.That’s where we come in.Tekkon helps startups scale their dev team without the hiring headaches!We handle recruitment, contracts, onboarding and people management - and connect you with top-tier remote devs at startup-friendly rates.Whether it’s full-stack, frontend, backend, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, UI/UX, data, or PMs - we’ve got your next hire (and tech-stack) covered.You focus on building your business. We’ll handle the tech talent.In fact, the smartest way to scale (in our humble opinion) is by blending a core local team with high-quality remote talent - something we’ve helped heaps of Aussie startups do for more than 8 years.Clients like Australian Tenders, Paperly, FinTech Australia, SpacetoCo, DiGii Social and more.Still burning hours on job ads or chasing candidates on LinkedIn?Maybe it’s time we had a chat.Or better yet - reach out to our clients and ask them what it’s like working with us.We’re ready when you are.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Scaling your startup and trying to grow your dev team at the same time?It’s tough to outgrow yourself and ramp up resources quickly - especially with a million other things competing for your time.But there are easier, more cost-effective ways to scale - without all the hiring headaches.Because for startups, it’s not just about finding talent. It’s also about: •	Affording top-tier local salaries •	Attracting great talent in a hyper-competitive market •	Navigating the entire recruitment process (especially if it’s your first few hires)And the time cost? Expect to spend 40 to 80 hours on: •	Writing job specs •	Posting job ads •	Vetting resumes •	Conducting interviews •	Salary negotiations •	Background checks •	Making offers •	Onboarding •	Ongoing retentionOffshoring might seem like a shortcut - but it comes with its own risks. Can you really evaluate their comms, tech skills, reliability, or even confirm they’re not juggling three other gigs?Let’s be honest - hiring great talent in Australia is hard.And finding reliable offshore devs? Even harder.That’s where we come in.Tekkon helps startups scale their dev team without the hiring headaches!We handle recruitment, contracts, onboarding and people management - and connect you with top-tier remote devs at startup-friendly rates.Whether it’s full-stack, frontend, backend, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, UI/UX, data, or PMs - we’ve got your next hire (and tech-stack) covered.You focus on building your business. We’ll handle the tech talent.In fact, the smartest way to scale (in our humble opinion) is by blending a core local team with high-quality remote talent - something we’ve helped heaps of Aussie startups do for more than 8 years.Clients like Australian Tenders, Paperly, FinTech Australia, SpacetoCo, DiGii Social and more.Still burning hours on job ads or chasing candidates on LinkedIn?Maybe it’s time we had a chat.Or better yet - reach out to our clients and ask them what it’s like working with us.We’re ready when you are.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for?

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.

Johnny DangJohnny Dang,,"🔍 Which Tech roles are you looking for ? 🚀 In my years of experience in IT outsourcing and Tech recruitment, I've had the chance to work closely with many tech founders. One common challenge that I often see is hiring the right talent in the early stages of their startup journey. It’s not that these founders lack vision or ambition, but rather, the difficulty often arises from not fully understanding the global hiring needs and costs associated with various tech positions.The table below is a quick breakdown of global average hourly rates for key positions. Knowing these rates can help tech founders set realistic expectations and avoid costly mistakes.🔍So, what does this mean for Tech startup ?- Specialized Roles Cost More: If your product is built around blockchain or AI, you're going to need specialized talent like AI/ML Engineers and Blockchain Developers. These roles are critical but come at a higher cost, with hourly rates ranging from 55 USD to 130 USD. While these positions are in high demand, they are essential for pushing your tech forward.- Core Roles Are More Affordable: For your foundational team, Back-end and Front-end Developers are the backbone. These positions are much more budget-friendly, with rates from 20 to 60 USD/hour, giving you more flexibility when scaling. You can hire junior developers if you’re just getting started, or bring in senior developers if you need more experience.- Outsourcing Can Be a Game Changer: If you’re trying to balance costs while still getting the talent you need, outsourcing might be a good option. Countries like Vietnam, India, and Ukraine offer developers with great skills, but at a much lower cost than hiring locally in the US or Europe. This can be a smart way to stretch your budget without sacrificing quality.- Invest in Long-Term Roles Early: While positions like DevOps and Security Engineers may not always be in high demand, these roles are key to ensuring the stability and scalability of your product in the long run. Investing in them early can save you a lot of trouble as your product and team grow.⏭️ Which positions are you hiring for? Let's connect and share your thoughts🔥 hashtag#TechStartups hashtag#HiringTalent hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Outsourcing hashtag#ITTalent hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TechTeam hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#TechFounders hashtag#ITOutsourcing

Oladapo AdenekanOladapo Adenekan,,"Title: DevOps and Cloud: How I Built Resilient Infrastructure with Automation and Scalability in MindIn a world where agility, security, and speed define the success of tech teams, DevOps and Cloud are no longer optional—they’re the foundation of digital innovation. But theory only goes so far. Today, I want to share how I combined both to build a Blue-Green Deployment architecture on AWS, using Terraform and GitHub Actions, from scratch.This wasn’t just another project—it was about proving what’s possible when you align automation, cloud-native design, and CI/CD pipelines with real-world delivery expectations.⸻My Project: Blue-Green Deployment on AWSThe goal was simple: enable zero-downtime deployments while ensuring high availability and easy rollback.Here’s how I approached it: •	Terraform was used to define infrastructure as code—creating two identical environments (Blue and Green) with VPC, subnets, ALB, EC2s, and security groups. •	I set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate code build, test, and deployment. •	Application Load Balancer (ALB) acted as the traffic switch. Once the Green environment was tested and verified, traffic was routed from Blue to Green. •	In case of issues, rollback was just one change away—no guesswork, no stress.⸻What I Learned •	Cloud and DevOps complement each other perfectly. Without AWS, I couldn’t have built a scalable solution. Without DevOps practices, I couldn’t have automated deployments or testing. •	Documentation matters. I created a comprehensive README.md with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and issues faced along the way—because real projects aren’t perfect. •	Automation is power. With one git push, my entire infrastructure spun up, code was deployed, and monitoring was active.⸻Beyond the Tools: A DevOps MindsetThis project wasn’t just about using Terraform or AWS. It was about building a solution that reflects DevOps values: •	Speed + Control — Deploy fast, but never blindly. •	Fail-Safe Design — If something breaks, recovery is instant. •	End-to-End Visibility — Logs, metrics, and alerts are baked into the workflow.⸻Final ThoughtsThis project helped me see how DevOps isn’t a job title—it’s a mindset. Cloud isn’t just where your app lives—it’s your entire ecosystem. Together, they unlock innovation at scale.If you’re a hiring manager looking for someone who can build, automate, and deliver, or if you’re transitioning into tech and wondering where to start—DevOps and Cloud are the perfect entry points.Feel free to check out the full project on my GitHub:github.com/oladapoadeLet’s connect and build something great together.
