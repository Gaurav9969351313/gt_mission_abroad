What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

Darren KwokDarren Kwok,,"To the hashtag#LinkedIn universeMe :""What could some transferrable possibilities? What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice. But like Karen Finerman said, “Waiting isn’t a life plan.” We don’t leave growth to chance—we build the conditions for it and you drive your own career narrative.So—what’s a skill or idea you’ve never put on a resume… but just might change everything?👇 Drop your favorite or add your own comments!

Darren KwokDarren Kwok,,"To the hashtag#LinkedIn universeMe :""What could some transferrable possibilities? What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice. But like Karen Finerman said, “Waiting isn’t a life plan.” We don’t leave growth to chance—we build the conditions for it and you drive your own career narrative.So—what’s a skill or idea you’ve never put on a resume… but just might change everything?👇 Drop your favorite or add your own comments!

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

Siddharth VermaSiddharth Verma,,"5 must-have traits you should look for in your founding engineer (Might be a little controversial) Your founding engineer will either become your biggest asset. Or your fastest way to burn out.So, check these traits before hiring them; 1/ 𝗢𝘄𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁If they wait to be told what to do, they’re not for you.You’ll spend more time managing than building.Your founding engineer should treat your product like it's theirs because, in many ways, it is.2/ 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀I’ve seen brilliant engineers who can write perfect code…But can’t hold a 5-minute conversation without going full technical jargon.You need someone who can translate tech into business value because Founding engineers must bridge the tech-business gap.Tell me how your code drives revenue, not just how elegant your solution is.3/ 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 & 𝗽𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆Nobody talks about this, but I will.Startups are messy, stressful, and full of chaos.If they burn out or disappear every few weeks, it’ll crush your momentum.You don’t need a gym freak.You just need someone who knows how to manage their stress and energy.4/ 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲They should know why they’re doing, what they’re doing.Don’t hire someone whose priorities are split.If they’re just testing out startups or thinking of freelancing on the side, walk away.Your founding team needs to be obsessed with the problem you’re solving.Not just the salary or the cool tech stack.5/ 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆See how quickly they’re able to learn. When you take interviews and if he’s a Python developer or React.Js developer, then ask him to set up DevOps to check their problem-solving skill. Founding engineers should be problem solvers. “Let me figure it out” > “That’s not my job.” Never hire a founding engineer without these 5.It’ll cost you more than just time.(Telling with my experience)What’s one trait you always look for in an early hire?

When you take interviews and if he’s a Python developer or React.Js developer, then ask him to set up DevOps to check their problem-solving skill. Founding engineers should be problem solvers. “Let me figure it out” > “That’s not my job.” Never hire a founding engineer without these 5.It’ll cost you more than just time.(Telling with my experience)What’s one trait you always look for in an early hire?

Siddharth VermaSiddharth Verma,,"5 must-have traits you should look for in your founding engineer (Might be a little controversial) Your founding engineer will either become your biggest asset. Or your fastest way to burn out.So, check these traits before hiring them; 1/ 𝗢𝘄𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁If they wait to be told what to do, they’re not for you.You’ll spend more time managing than building.Your founding engineer should treat your product like it's theirs because, in many ways, it is.2/ 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀I’ve seen brilliant engineers who can write perfect code…But can’t hold a 5-minute conversation without going full technical jargon.You need someone who can translate tech into business value because Founding engineers must bridge the tech-business gap.Tell me how your code drives revenue, not just how elegant your solution is.3/ 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 & 𝗽𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆Nobody talks about this, but I will.Startups are messy, stressful, and full of chaos.If they burn out or disappear every few weeks, it’ll crush your momentum.You don’t need a gym freak.You just need someone who knows how to manage their stress and energy.4/ 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲They should know why they’re doing, what they’re doing.Don’t hire someone whose priorities are split.If they’re just testing out startups or thinking of freelancing on the side, walk away.Your founding team needs to be obsessed with the problem you’re solving.Not just the salary or the cool tech stack.5/ 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆See how quickly they’re able to learn. When you take interviews and if he’s a Python developer or React.Js developer, then ask him to set up DevOps to check their problem-solving skill. Founding engineers should be problem solvers. “Let me figure it out” > “That’s not my job.” Never hire a founding engineer without these 5.It’ll cost you more than just time.(Telling with my experience)What’s one trait you always look for in an early hire?
