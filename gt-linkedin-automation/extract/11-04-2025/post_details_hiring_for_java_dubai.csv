That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai.

Unlike its neighboring areas, its pristine beaches and historical landmarks remain largely unspoiled, attracting growing interest from both local and international investors.Recently, UAE-based Tiger Group announced a major entry into Syria’s real estate sector, committing over $530 million to infrastructure, education, healthcare, and property development, with a special focus on coastal cities like Jableh. This move signals an emerging economic openness in the region, positioning Jableh as a top contender for investment and tourism growth in the Eastern Mediterranean.As nature, heritage, and strategic geography converge, Jableh is quickly transforming into a real opportunity on the ground.What are your thoughts on Syria’s evolving real estate landscape?hashtag#Jableh hashtag#Syria hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#Tourism hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#TigerGroup hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#EmergingMarkets

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

Ayyappa Dass KunnathAyyappa Dass Kunnath,,"George V Nereamparambil, originally from Kerala, India, is famously known as the ‘King of Burj Khalifa’. He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Sri Lalitha KSri Lalitha K,,"💫In the chessboard of international Business, Licencing is the Queen - Versatile, powerful and strategic 💫. Licensing is a vital strategy that enables global brands to operate securely and expand responsibility. It involves granting legal rights to use a company’s brand, logo, or product under specific terms.🇦🇪Emirates Airlines, the flagship carrier of the UAE, uses licensing to manage its global presence.✈️The airline holds international aviation licenses to operate safely across over 150 destinations.Emirates licenses its brand for official merchandise like model aircraft, apparel, and accessories.It also ensures that its digital platforms, including online booking and apps, are properly licensed.Licensing protects Emirates' intellectual property and ensures consistency across all markets.Through partnerships, it extends its brand to retail, media, and promotional collaborations.Countries like the USA, UK, and Germany require Emirates to comply with local licensing laws.Overall, licensing supports Emirates’ trusted reputation, safety, and global brand recognition.hashtag#globalbusiness hashtag#licensing hashtag#Emiratesairlines hashtag#brandexpansion hashtag#legalcomplience Thankyou Ravindran D Praajna P Gowda Sahana M Pravith MM Skanda Idyadka Sanjana A Ashwin B K

They care about outcomes.What actually works in 2024?➜ Stop selling “Dubai.” Sell the exit strategy (tax-free wealth, safety, liquidity).➜ Drop the script. The best deals here happen in whispers—not PowerPoints.➜ Forget “decision makers.” Target the gatekeepers (PAs, family offices, lawyers).The Fix:╰┈➤ Sell like you’re from here (even if you’re not):➪ Niche harder: “I help crypto founders buy penthouses quietly” > “I sell real estate.”➪ Use social proof: “My client saved 37% on off-plan—here’s how” > “Trust me.”➪ Be the insider: Share real market gaps (e.g., “Why Germans are buying Ras Al Khaimah now”).The Result? → Less pitching.

Over the years, we’ve crossed paths in several business communities and clubs, including the Capital Club DubaiA little about Ali Mousa & Sons Holding Group (AMSHG) — founded in 1978 by Mr. Ali Mousa Alnaqbi in Khorfakkan, the group has evolved into a powerhouse in the UAE, with operations in construction, industrial services, MEP, aluminum & glass, joinery, real estate, and beyond.

Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other.

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Jack JendoJack Jendo,,"Can the Middle East Become the World’s Next Economic Power?⸻With digital infrastructure booming and Gulf economies leading the charge, the Middle East stands at a turning point.In my latest article on Annahar, I explore how the region can transition from fragmented markets to a unified digital economy—one that doesn’t just catch up, but competes globally.⸻Why this matters:– The world is shifting from oil to algorithms– Economic power is no longer about size—it’s about digital readiness– The Middle East has the talent, capital, and momentum to lead—if it acts together– After all, this region once sparked civilization—why not lead again with vision, unity, and a human-centered digital future?– With the right leadership and regional alignment, we don’t need to imitate others—we can build something original, grounded in our history and shaped by innovation.⸻Lebanon, despite its crisis, still has a role to play.Our strength lies in innovation, resilience, and regional collaboration.Read the full piece on Annahar, English:https://lnkd.in/gC-bGRiMArabic version: https://annah.ar/207197hashtag#MiddleEastEconomy hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#RegionalLeadership hashtag#Annahar hashtag#FutureEconomy hashtag#SmartGrowth hashtag#EconomicPower hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#DigitalUnity

Over the years, we’ve crossed paths in several business communities and clubs, including the Capital Club DubaiA little about Ali Mousa & Sons Holding Group (AMSHG) — founded in 1978 by Mr. Ali Mousa Alnaqbi in Khorfakkan, the group has evolved into a powerhouse in the UAE, with operations in construction, industrial services, MEP, aluminum & glass, joinery, real estate, and beyond. Their footprint spans Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Qatar, and KSA.During our conversation, we also discussed philanthropic housing initiatives across the region and globally, aiming to support vulnerable communities and those in need — a vision we both deeply care about.Below is a photo from our gathering this week.جمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزهذا الأسبوع في دبي، سعدت بلقاء صديق قديم وقائد مميز، سعادة الشيخ أحمد النقبي علي موسى — علاقة بدأت قبل ما يقرب من 25 عاماً.كانت بدايتنا معاً أثناء تطوير مشروعهم الشهير لبناء سبع فلل في منطقة النوف بالشارقة، والذي شكل انطلاقة لتعاونات متعددة في مجالات البناء، التكنولوجيا، والرعاية الصحية. وعلى مدار السنوات، اجتمعنا في العديد من المجتمعات والنوادي التجارية، بما في ذلك كابيتال كلوب دبي.نبذة عن مجموعة علي موسى وأولاده القابضة — تأسست عام 1978 في خورفكان، ونمت لتصبح من أبرز المجموعات الإقليمية في خدمات البناء والصناعات المرتبطة بها. تمتد عملياتهم من الشارقة إلى دبي وأبوظبي وعجمان، وصولاً إلى قطر والمملكة العربية السعودية، وتشمل مشاريع سكنية وتجارية وتعليمية وحكومية.كما تناول حديثنا مبادرات إنسانية لبناء مساكن للمجتمعات المحتاجة، إقليمياً وعالمياً، انطلاقاً من التزام مشترك تجاه الخير والتنمية المجتمعية.أدناه صورة من لقائنا لهذا الأسبوع.hashtag#UAELeaders hashtag#KhaleejiConnect hashtag#LegacyOfImpact hashtag#AliMousaGroup hashtag#RegionalDevelopment hashtag#جمعة_مباركة hashtag#التنمية_المستدامة hashtag#العمل_الإنساني

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well!

Their footprint spans Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Qatar, and KSA.During our conversation, we also discussed philanthropic housing initiatives across the region and globally, aiming to support vulnerable communities and those in need — a vision we both deeply care about.Below is a photo from our gathering this week.جمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزهذا الأسبوع في دبي، سعدت بلقاء صديق قديم وقائد مميز، سعادة الشيخ أحمد النقبي علي موسى — علاقة بدأت قبل ما يقرب من 25 عاماً.كانت بدايتنا معاً أثناء تطوير مشروعهم الشهير لبناء سبع فلل في منطقة النوف بالشارقة، والذي شكل انطلاقة لتعاونات متعددة في مجالات البناء، التكنولوجيا، والرعاية الصحية. وعلى مدار السنوات، اجتمعنا في العديد من المجتمعات والنوادي التجارية، بما في ذلك كابيتال كلوب دبي.نبذة عن مجموعة علي موسى وأولاده القابضة — تأسست عام 1978 في خورفكان، ونمت لتصبح من أبرز المجموعات الإقليمية في خدمات البناء والصناعات المرتبطة بها. تمتد عملياتهم من الشارقة إلى دبي وأبوظبي وعجمان، وصولاً إلى قطر والمملكة العربية السعودية، وتشمل مشاريع سكنية وتجارية وتعليمية وحكومية.كما تناول حديثنا مبادرات إنسانية لبناء مساكن للمجتمعات المحتاجة، إقليمياً وعالمياً، انطلاقاً من التزام مشترك تجاه الخير والتنمية المجتمعية.أدناه صورة من لقائنا لهذا الأسبوع.hashtag#UAELeaders hashtag#KhaleejiConnect hashtag#LegacyOfImpact hashtag#AliMousaGroup hashtag#RegionalDevelopment hashtag#جمعة_مباركة hashtag#التنمية_المستدامة hashtag#العمل_الإنساني

The presence of:- 81,200 resident millionaires (with liquid investable wealth over $1 million),- 237 centi-millionaires (with $100 million+),- and 20 billionaires...shows not just economic strength, but also Dubai’s appeal to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) seeking a mix of lifestyle, business opportunity, and tax-friendly policies.This kind of concentration of wealth signals strong demand for luxury real estate, premium financial services, and exclusive lifestyle experiences—making Dubai a ripe market for developers, investors, and businesses catering to upper-middle to elite classes.I feel like dancing.

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors. The emirate's commitment to sustainable development and its diverse economy further solidify its position as a prime real estate investment hub in 2025.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors. The emirate's commitment to sustainable development and its diverse economy further solidify its position as a prime real estate investment hub in 2025.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

Unlike its neighboring areas, its pristine beaches and historical landmarks remain largely unspoiled, attracting growing interest from both local and international investors.Recently, UAE-based Tiger Group announced a major entry into Syria’s real estate sector, committing over $530 million to infrastructure, education, healthcare, and property development, with a special focus on coastal cities like Jableh. This move signals an emerging economic openness in the region, positioning Jableh as a top contender for investment and tourism growth in the Eastern Mediterranean.As nature, heritage, and strategic geography converge, Jableh is quickly transforming into a real opportunity on the ground.What are your thoughts on Syria’s evolving real estate landscape?hashtag#Jableh hashtag#Syria hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#Tourism hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#TigerGroup hashtag#EconomicGrowth hashtag#EmergingMarkets

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment.

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Their footprint spans Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Qatar, and KSA.During our conversation, we also discussed philanthropic housing initiatives across the region and globally, aiming to support vulnerable communities and those in need — a vision we both deeply care about.Below is a photo from our gathering this week.جمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزهذا الأسبوع في دبي، سعدت بلقاء صديق قديم وقائد مميز، سعادة الشيخ أحمد النقبي علي موسى — علاقة بدأت قبل ما يقرب من 25 عاماً.كانت بدايتنا معاً أثناء تطوير مشروعهم الشهير لبناء سبع فلل في منطقة النوف بالشارقة، والذي شكل انطلاقة لتعاونات متعددة في مجالات البناء، التكنولوجيا، والرعاية الصحية. وعلى مدار السنوات، اجتمعنا في العديد من المجتمعات والنوادي التجارية، بما في ذلك كابيتال كلوب دبي.نبذة عن مجموعة علي موسى وأولاده القابضة — تأسست عام 1978 في خورفكان، ونمت لتصبح من أبرز المجموعات الإقليمية في خدمات البناء والصناعات المرتبطة بها. تمتد عملياتهم من الشارقة إلى دبي وأبوظبي وعجمان، وصولاً إلى قطر والمملكة العربية السعودية، وتشمل مشاريع سكنية وتجارية وتعليمية وحكومية.كما تناول حديثنا مبادرات إنسانية لبناء مساكن للمجتمعات المحتاجة، إقليمياً وعالمياً، انطلاقاً من التزام مشترك تجاه الخير والتنمية المجتمعية.أدناه صورة من لقائنا لهذا الأسبوع.hashtag#UAELeaders hashtag#KhaleejiConnect hashtag#LegacyOfImpact hashtag#AliMousaGroup hashtag#RegionalDevelopment hashtag#جمعة_مباركة hashtag#التنمية_المستدامة hashtag#العمل_الإنساني

The presence of:- 81,200 resident millionaires (with liquid investable wealth over $1 million),- 237 centi-millionaires (with $100 million+),- and 20 billionaires...shows not just economic strength, but also Dubai’s appeal to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) seeking a mix of lifestyle, business opportunity, and tax-friendly policies.This kind of concentration of wealth signals strong demand for luxury real estate, premium financial services, and exclusive lifestyle experiences—making Dubai a ripe market for developers, investors, and businesses catering to upper-middle to elite classes.I feel like dancing.

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

Mathew SamuelMathew Samuel,,"Sharjah's real estate sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, making it an attractive destination for investors. In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors. The emirate's commitment to sustainable development and its diverse economy further solidify its position as a prime real estate investment hub in 2025.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well!

Jack JendoJack Jendo,,"Can the Middle East Become the World’s Next Economic Power?⸻With digital infrastructure booming and Gulf economies leading the charge, the Middle East stands at a turning point.In my latest article on Annahar, I explore how the region can transition from fragmented markets to a unified digital economy—one that doesn’t just catch up, but competes globally.⸻Why this matters:– The world is shifting from oil to algorithms– Economic power is no longer about size—it’s about digital readiness– The Middle East has the talent, capital, and momentum to lead—if it acts together– After all, this region once sparked civilization—why not lead again with vision, unity, and a human-centered digital future?– With the right leadership and regional alignment, we don’t need to imitate others—we can build something original, grounded in our history and shaped by innovation.⸻Lebanon, despite its crisis, still has a role to play.Our strength lies in innovation, resilience, and regional collaboration.Read the full piece on Annahar, English:https://lnkd.in/gC-bGRiMArabic version: https://annah.ar/207197hashtag#MiddleEastEconomy hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#RegionalLeadership hashtag#Annahar hashtag#FutureEconomy hashtag#SmartGrowth hashtag#EconomicPower hashtag#Lebanon hashtag#DigitalUnity

Shefiq AbdullaShefiq Abdulla,,"Juma Mubarak & Khaleeji Connectجمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزThis week in Dubai, I had the pleasure of reconnecting with a longtime friend and respected leader, His Excellency Sheikh Ahmed Alnaqbi Ali Moosa — a relationship that dates back nearly 25 years.We first met during the development of their iconic seven villas in Al Nouf, Sharjah — a project that marked the beginning of many meaningful collaborations across sectors including construction, technology, and healthcare. Over the years, we’ve crossed paths in several business communities and clubs, including the Capital Club DubaiA little about Ali Mousa & Sons Holding Group (AMSHG) — founded in 1978 by Mr. Ali Mousa Alnaqbi in Khorfakkan, the group has evolved into a powerhouse in the UAE, with operations in construction, industrial services, MEP, aluminum & glass, joinery, real estate, and beyond. Their footprint spans Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Qatar, and KSA.During our conversation, we also discussed philanthropic housing initiatives across the region and globally, aiming to support vulnerable communities and those in need — a vision we both deeply care about.Below is a photo from our gathering this week.جمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزهذا الأسبوع في دبي، سعدت بلقاء صديق قديم وقائد مميز، سعادة الشيخ أحمد النقبي علي موسى — علاقة بدأت قبل ما يقرب من 25 عاماً.كانت بدايتنا معاً أثناء تطوير مشروعهم الشهير لبناء سبع فلل في منطقة النوف بالشارقة، والذي شكل انطلاقة لتعاونات متعددة في مجالات البناء، التكنولوجيا، والرعاية الصحية. وعلى مدار السنوات، اجتمعنا في العديد من المجتمعات والنوادي التجارية، بما في ذلك كابيتال كلوب دبي.نبذة عن مجموعة علي موسى وأولاده القابضة — تأسست عام 1978 في خورفكان، ونمت لتصبح من أبرز المجموعات الإقليمية في خدمات البناء والصناعات المرتبطة بها. تمتد عملياتهم من الشارقة إلى دبي وأبوظبي وعجمان، وصولاً إلى قطر والمملكة العربية السعودية، وتشمل مشاريع سكنية وتجارية وتعليمية وحكومية.كما تناول حديثنا مبادرات إنسانية لبناء مساكن للمجتمعات المحتاجة، إقليمياً وعالمياً، انطلاقاً من التزام مشترك تجاه الخير والتنمية المجتمعية.أدناه صورة من لقائنا لهذا الأسبوع.hashtag#UAELeaders hashtag#KhaleejiConnect hashtag#LegacyOfImpact hashtag#AliMousaGroup hashtag#RegionalDevelopment hashtag#جمعة_مباركة hashtag#التنمية_المستدامة hashtag#العمل_الإنساني

Dana AwadallahDana Awadallah,,"Is It a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Dubai? Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

It involves granting legal rights to use a company’s brand, logo, or product under specific terms.🇦🇪Emirates Airlines, the flagship carrier of the UAE, uses licensing to manage its global presence.✈️The airline holds international aviation licenses to operate safely across over 150 destinations.Emirates licenses its brand for official merchandise like model aircraft, apparel, and accessories.It also ensures that its digital platforms, including online booking and apps, are properly licensed.Licensing protects Emirates' intellectual property and ensures consistency across all markets.Through partnerships, it extends its brand to retail, media, and promotional collaborations.Countries like the USA, UK, and Germany require Emirates to comply with local licensing laws.Overall, licensing supports Emirates’ trusted reputation, safety, and global brand recognition.hashtag#globalbusiness hashtag#licensing hashtag#Emiratesairlines hashtag#brandexpansion hashtag#legalcomplience Thankyou Ravindran D Praajna P Gowda Sahana M Pravith MM Skanda Idyadka Sanjana A Ashwin B K

They care about outcomes.What actually works in 2024?➜ Stop selling “Dubai.” Sell the exit strategy (tax-free wealth, safety, liquidity).➜ Drop the script. The best deals here happen in whispers—not PowerPoints.➜ Forget “decision makers.” Target the gatekeepers (PAs, family offices, lawyers).The Fix:╰┈➤ Sell like you’re from here (even if you’re not):➪ Niche harder: “I help crypto founders buy penthouses quietly” > “I sell real estate.”➪ Use social proof: “My client saved 37% on off-plan—here’s how” > “Trust me.”➪ Be the insider: Share real market gaps (e.g., “Why Germans are buying Ras Al Khaimah now”).The Result? → Less pitching.

Over the years, we’ve crossed paths in several business communities and clubs, including the Capital Club DubaiA little about Ali Mousa & Sons Holding Group (AMSHG) — founded in 1978 by Mr. Ali Mousa Alnaqbi in Khorfakkan, the group has evolved into a powerhouse in the UAE, with operations in construction, industrial services, MEP, aluminum & glass, joinery, real estate, and beyond. Their footprint spans Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Qatar, and KSA.During our conversation, we also discussed philanthropic housing initiatives across the region and globally, aiming to support vulnerable communities and those in need — a vision we both deeply care about.Below is a photo from our gathering this week.جمعة مباركة وربط خليجي مميزهذا الأسبوع في دبي، سعدت بلقاء صديق قديم وقائد مميز، سعادة الشيخ أحمد النقبي علي موسى — علاقة بدأت قبل ما يقرب من 25 عاماً.كانت بدايتنا معاً أثناء تطوير مشروعهم الشهير لبناء سبع فلل في منطقة النوف بالشارقة، والذي شكل انطلاقة لتعاونات متعددة في مجالات البناء، التكنولوجيا، والرعاية الصحية. وعلى مدار السنوات، اجتمعنا في العديد من المجتمعات والنوادي التجارية، بما في ذلك كابيتال كلوب دبي.نبذة عن مجموعة علي موسى وأولاده القابضة — تأسست عام 1978 في خورفكان، ونمت لتصبح من أبرز المجموعات الإقليمية في خدمات البناء والصناعات المرتبطة بها. تمتد عملياتهم من الشارقة إلى دبي وأبوظبي وعجمان، وصولاً إلى قطر والمملكة العربية السعودية، وتشمل مشاريع سكنية وتجارية وتعليمية وحكومية.كما تناول حديثنا مبادرات إنسانية لبناء مساكن للمجتمعات المحتاجة، إقليمياً وعالمياً، انطلاقاً من التزام مشترك تجاه الخير والتنمية المجتمعية.أدناه صورة من لقائنا لهذا الأسبوع.hashtag#UAELeaders hashtag#KhaleejiConnect hashtag#LegacyOfImpact hashtag#AliMousaGroup hashtag#RegionalDevelopment hashtag#جمعة_مباركة hashtag#التنمية_المستدامة hashtag#العمل_الإنساني

Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.

Estleys Real EstateEstleys Real Estate,,"You know that feeling when everything around the world feels a little shaky? Interest rates climbing, markets slowing down, political uncertainty in the air? That’s the reality many investors are waking up to in 2025.And yet, here’s Dubai, standing tall, steady, and more attractive than ever.Over the past year, we’ve seen something remarkable unfold. While global giants are tightening up, Dubai’s real estate market is opening its arms, and the world is responding.Buyers from Europe, South Asia, and even Africa are turning their gaze here. Not just for the sunshine or the skyline, but for something deeper: stability, opportunity, and a smart place to grow their wealth.Why now? Because in cities worldwide, higher interest rates have made borrowing tough. In contrast, Dubai offers ease, a cash-friendly market with no property tax, no capital gains tax, and investor-centric policies. It’s not just a nice alternative; it’s a smart financial move.But it’s more than just numbers.People are moving here — families, entrepreneurs, digital nomads. They’re choosing neighborhoods like Tilal Al Ghaf, Arabian Ranches 3, and Dubai Creek Harbour not just because they’re luxurious, but because they feel like home. Safe. Vibrant. Forward-looking. Communities that are being handed over now, ready to live in, not just dreams on paper.We’re watching record off-plan sales, surging demand for co-living spaces, and commercial investments picking up. And it’s all happening because Dubai saw the global shift coming, and prepared.Long-term visas, golden residency, flexible payment plans, strong currency ties, all of it tells one story: Dubai isn’t just surviving the global storm; it’s thriving in it.So whether you're an investor rethinking your next move, or just someone wondering where the world is headed, keep an eye on Dubai. What’s happening here is more than a trend. It’s a reflection of what the future of global living and investing could look like.hashtag#realestatedubai hashtag#propertyinvestmentdubai hashtag#dubaimarket2025 hashtag#dubairealestate2025 hashtag#realestate2025 hashtag#uaemarketinsight hashtag#uaerealestate hashtag#propertyinvestment

Lucy JoyceLucy Joyce,,"🧳 Relocating for Real Estate: How to Know if It’s the Right Move for YouMoving to a new country to start fresh in real estate is a huge decision, and definitely not one to take lightly. When I made the move, I was excited, nervous, and honestly had no idea how much it would change me, both personally and professionally.Dubai is full of opportunity, but it’s also full of challenges. You need to be self-motivated, open to learning, and ready to step outside your comfort zone daily. There’s no base salary, so success comes down to you - your mindset, your work ethic, and your ability to keep going even when things feel uncertain.But on the flip side, the rewards can be incredible. You get to live in a city where people dream big, work hard, and genuinely support each other. The lifestyle, the people, the growth… it’s unmatched.If you’re thinking about relocating for real estate, ask yourself:→ Are you ready to bet on yourself?→ Can you handle the ups and downs without giving up?→ Do you want to build something that’s truly yours?If the answer is yes, it might just be the best move you ever make💭

He owns a staggering 22 luxury apartments in the world’s tallest building and has an estimated net worth of ₹4,800 crore. His journey from a small town to the pinnacle of real estate success in Dubai is nothing short of extraordinary.Born into a modest family, George began helping his father with cash crop transportation at the age of 11. Even at a young age, he showcased sharp business acumen by launching a small venture where he extracted gum from discarded cotton seeds—an early sign of his entrepreneurial mindset.After moving to the Middle East in the 1970s, George established the GEEBEES Group, which operates across sectors such as construction, trading, engineering, and real estate. His deep passion for Dubai led him to invest heavily in the Burj Khalifa, starting with one apartment. As of today, he owns 22 units and has expressed interest in owning even more, purely driven by ambition, not luxury.His story is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs—showing that with vision, resilience, and hard work, even the sky isn’t the limit.Gratitude to the original owner hashtag#GeorgeVNereamparambil hashtag#BurjKhalifaKing hashtag#IndianEntrepreneur hashtag#FromKeralaToDubai hashtag#RealEstateTycoon hashtag#SuccessStory hashtag#InspiringJourney hashtag#BurjKhalifaApartments hashtag#DreamBig hashtag#WealthCreation hashtag#GeeBeesGroup hashtag#indiansuccessabroad

Liam Moir-HollandLiam Moir-Holland,,"Is London really that bad right now?For the past 12 days, I’ve been back in London, making the most of the Eid break to catch up with some of our London based customers, attend a wedding, celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday, and catch up with friends and family.I’ll be honest, I was a bit anxious about going back for this long (usually it’s for shorter periods). The UK is getting a lot of bad press right now, for a number of valid reasons. And being out here in Dubai, where there are so many UK expats, there’s definitely a bit of a “hate culture” towards the place.But truthfully, I think London deserves a bit of slack. Visiting the city where I first moved after university to get into recruitment you really can’t beat the energy. The city vibe, the hustle and bustle of the morning commute, getting shoved aside on the Underground if you’re not walking fast enough... it all makes you feel like you’re up to something and on a mission to succeed.Some might disagree, but I genuinely believe this kind of environment sets the tone for the day. It's something I feel Dubai lacks with all the convenience, great weather, and beaches, people are generally more laid back. Which got me thinking...is that always the best environment for a commission based sales job? You need to be a go getter!Along side this there is still so many amazing tech businesses thriving, building innovative products and doing extremely well! The job market is also the busiest we have seen in a long time.One thing’s for sure though… When the sun’s out, London is still the best city in the world!Talent Connect Group (TCG)hashtag#Londonhashtag#Dubai

Here’s What You Need to Know This QuarterDubai real estate market is always evolving, but if you're wondering whether this quarter favors buyers, sellers, or investors, here's a quick breakdown:1. Price Adjustments Are Creating Buyer Opportunities:We're seeing price corrections in some areas, especially mid-range apartments. For buyers, this means better negotiation power in the secondary market.2. Low Inventory in Prime Locations Favors Sellers:Communities like Downtown, Palm Jumeirah, and Marina are still experiencing limited availability. This puts sellers in a strong position with quicker sales and solid returns.3. Off-Plan Remains Popular—but Timing Is Everything:Off-plan sales are steady, but delayed handovers and long commission cycles make it a longer game. Secondary may offer more immediate results for those needing cash flow.Bottom line:It’s a mixed market.- Buyers can find value with the right strategy.- Sellers still win in high-demand areas.- Investors need to choose smartly between quick gains and long-term plays.The right advice from our consultants at The VIP Real Estate can make all the difference.hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateDubai hashtag#DubaiProperty hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#SecondaryMarketDubai hashtag#OffPlanDubai hashtag#BuyersMarket hashtag#SellersMarket hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#InvestInDubai hashtag#UAERealEstate hashtag#PropertyTrends hashtag#RealEstateTips

In 2024, the emirate recorded transactions worth AED40 billion ($10.9 billion), marking a 48% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to Sharjah's strategic location adjacent to Dubai, offering excellent connectivity via major highways, ports, and airports. Additionally, the government's investor-friendly policies, including relaxed ownership regulations and economic stimulus packages, have enhanced the emirate's appeal. With affordable property prices and high rental yields averaging between 8% and 10%, Sharjah presents lucrative opportunities for both seasoned and new investors.
