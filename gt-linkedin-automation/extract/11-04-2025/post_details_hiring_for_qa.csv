Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again. I always knew this lovely little network of mine would have a bigger part to play one day 🙏 A forever grateful Char x

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again. I always knew this lovely little network of mine would have a bigger part to play one day 🙏 A forever grateful Char x

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again. I always knew this lovely little network of mine would have a bigger part to play one day 🙏 A forever grateful Char x

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again. I always knew this lovely little network of mine would have a bigger part to play one day 🙏 A forever grateful Char x

Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility.

We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann.

Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again. I always knew this lovely little network of mine would have a bigger part to play one day 🙏 A forever grateful Char x

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility.

But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what?

Charlotte BakerCharlotte Baker,,"Elvie has a new home 🥺I’m feeling a lot of feels right now.A part of me is completely and utterly heartbroken that the Elvie era is coming to an end. Another part of me is incredibly excited that two amazing brands, with a shared vision for improving women’s lives and health are coming together. Ultimately, that was our mission at Elvie and we’ll always live on through Willow Innovations, Inc. ❤️ As Elvie’s Talent Partner I feel this undeniable sense of responsibility. Knowing I’ve hired people into the business who have now sadly been made redundant is in all honesty, gut wrenching. But I’ve been channelling that energy into building an incredible redundancy support programme which we’ll be rolling out next week, for the next four weeks. We've already secured some amazing redundancy support specialists and speakers - Tom Crawford, Georgina Kvassay, Sofia Eiworth, Mark Ramsay (Chartered FCIPD), Helen Tomlinson, Catherine Sibbald, Tammy Potter and Jeremy Behrmann. Thank you so much for being just fantastic supportive humans ❤️I’ve also had so many lovely conversations with people who literally owe me/us nothing. Thank you Luke Watts 🏃‍♂️, Sam Salter, Helen Tomlinson, Gina Sumner, Casey B. and George Booth who have offered advice and support. It means the world 🌎 So now what? Well, for the rest of my tenure at Elvie I’m going to do everything in my power to help the incredible talent here make connections and ultimately help them find something new. Basically what I’m asking is you all to rally up and share this far and wide!! We have people in the following crafts: - Engineers (Design, IT, System, Mobile, Software, Firmware, Hardware)- Product, Delivery, Project Managers - Head of’s, Exec Level and Directors - (variety of different crafts) - Marketing, Finance, Legal and Commercial- Testing & QA - Quality & Regulatory Affairs - User Research If you are hiring, know someone who is or you’re a recruiter who wants a fantastic candidate to work with then please comment, tag, share and tag again.
