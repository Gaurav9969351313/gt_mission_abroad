Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake?

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity. I don't just predict, but can shape your future with Analytics.hashtag#DataAnalyticshashtag#mydatajourneyhashtag#ALXCertified

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity. I don't just predict, but can shape your future with Analytics.hashtag#DataAnalyticshashtag#mydatajourneyhashtag#ALXCertified

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity. I don't just predict, but can shape your future with Analytics.hashtag#DataAnalyticshashtag#mydatajourneyhashtag#ALXCertified

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Rajendra TiwariRajendra Tiwari,,"🧰 Things Marine Engineers Secretly Want from Their Chemical Suppliers (but rarely get):⚡ Fast answers without chasing. When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Rajendra TiwariRajendra Tiwari,,"🧰 Things Marine Engineers Secretly Want from Their Chemical Suppliers (but rarely get):⚡ Fast answers without chasing. When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening. Always. 👂⚓hashtag#Innovation hashtag#ThoughtLeadership hashtag#MarineIndustry hashtag#ChemicalIndustry hashtag#ShippingIndustry hashtag#Seafaring hashtag#MaritimeTechnology hashtag#CustomerSuccess hashtag#SupportTeam hashtag#hiring hashtag#ProductDevelopment

Kalyani GhuleKalyani Ghule,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model.

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers.

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity. I don't just predict, but can shape your future with Analytics.hashtag#DataAnalyticshashtag#mydatajourneyhashtag#ALXCertified

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Gemma KentishGemma Kentish,,"""More people were added to the large pool of jobseekers in March than at any point since the pandemic, according to recruiters, as high levels of redundancies are driving a “steeper rise” in staff availability. Employers have come under greater strain in the months since Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ announced a £25bn national insurance tax raid on firms, which came into effect last Sunday. Now a new joint survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG suggests that the jobs market took a turn for the worse in March. Redundancies drove the biggest rise in the number of jobseekers since late 2020, recruiters said, pointing to a likely deterioration in UK unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment levels held steady at 4.4 per cent in February but leading economists, including those within the government and at the Resolution Foundation think tank, have questioned the validity of its labour market data. Recruiters and employment consultancies told REC and KPMG researchers that fewer job opportunities also contributed to a rise in the number of people available for work. The broad survey also showed that month-on-month hiring activity has been slowing consecutively for two-and-a-half years. London was the only region to see recruitment pick up as a gap between the North and the capital city widened further. Vacancies also fell last month, with jobseekers looking for permanent positions more deeply affected. March was the 19th month in a row that demand for permanent staff had dropped. The figures are likely to come as a headache for Reeves as she seeks to reverse the UK’s low growth outlook and get people into work.REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: “Given the substantial effects of the government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.“Activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”Recruiters claimed there was a high demand for skills in various key service sectors including IT and accounting. The types of jobs recruiters claimed there were shortages in included financial analysts, auditors and software engineers. KPMG’s group chief executive Jon Holt said behaviour among employers had vastly changed as higher taxes and compliance with Labour’s controversial Employment Rights Bill were set to add to costs. “With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent,” he said. Holt added that there was little cause for optimism as President Trump’s tariffs could stir up a new storm for employers. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”https://lnkd.in/e_geHQcE

A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Gemma KentishGemma Kentish,,"""More people were added to the large pool of jobseekers in March than at any point since the pandemic, according to recruiters, as high levels of redundancies are driving a “steeper rise” in staff availability. Employers have come under greater strain in the months since Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ announced a £25bn national insurance tax raid on firms, which came into effect last Sunday. Now a new joint survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG suggests that the jobs market took a turn for the worse in March. Redundancies drove the biggest rise in the number of jobseekers since late 2020, recruiters said, pointing to a likely deterioration in UK unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment levels held steady at 4.4 per cent in February but leading economists, including those within the government and at the Resolution Foundation think tank, have questioned the validity of its labour market data. Recruiters and employment consultancies told REC and KPMG researchers that fewer job opportunities also contributed to a rise in the number of people available for work. The broad survey also showed that month-on-month hiring activity has been slowing consecutively for two-and-a-half years. London was the only region to see recruitment pick up as a gap between the North and the capital city widened further. Vacancies also fell last month, with jobseekers looking for permanent positions more deeply affected. March was the 19th month in a row that demand for permanent staff had dropped. The figures are likely to come as a headache for Reeves as she seeks to reverse the UK’s low growth outlook and get people into work.REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: “Given the substantial effects of the government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.“Activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”Recruiters claimed there was a high demand for skills in various key service sectors including IT and accounting. The types of jobs recruiters claimed there were shortages in included financial analysts, auditors and software engineers. KPMG’s group chief executive Jon Holt said behaviour among employers had vastly changed as higher taxes and compliance with Labour’s controversial Employment Rights Bill were set to add to costs. “With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent,” he said. Holt added that there was little cause for optimism as President Trump’s tariffs could stir up a new storm for employers. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”https://lnkd.in/e_geHQcE

Chris RyanChris Ryan,,"Are you drowning in factory KPIs or frustrated about outdated dashboards? Let’s talk about taming that data zoo. 🦁🐘Tracking plant availability manually can be frustrating. It's even worse if you're always behind on reporting errors that have already passed. And what about the heaps of data you can't make sense of?Yesterday’s smart factory workshop with Next Industries and OCTOTRONIC tackled these challenges head-on. 🎉We got hands-on designing our own Unified Namespace (or UNS, for short). It's not perfect for every scenario, but WOW—it brings order to chaos. Proper contextualization for YOUR telemetry data is key.Some of the highlights:➡️ Ottmar Matthias Müller shared VAT's Smart Factory vision, including his Edge/ UNS Adapter Architecture.➡️ Tim Frech discussed avoiding KPI fatigue while making KPIs truly effective.➡️ Alexej Ziegler showed us how UNS tames chaotic data, making factory insights accessible.Thanks also Matthias Kühne for the - as always - excellent organization 👏Key takeaway? UNS forces you rethink how structure plant data from start. Clean, contextualized data empowers operators and sharpens decision-making to extract value out of their data WHEN they really need it.What’s your biggest data challenge right now? Have you tried implementing something like UNS or do you think this is overkill?Bonus pic: LEGO Smart Factory Pic 🏭 🚀

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids.

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Gemma KentishGemma Kentish,,"""More people were added to the large pool of jobseekers in March than at any point since the pandemic, according to recruiters, as high levels of redundancies are driving a “steeper rise” in staff availability. Employers have come under greater strain in the months since Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ announced a £25bn national insurance tax raid on firms, which came into effect last Sunday. Now a new joint survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG suggests that the jobs market took a turn for the worse in March. Redundancies drove the biggest rise in the number of jobseekers since late 2020, recruiters said, pointing to a likely deterioration in UK unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment levels held steady at 4.4 per cent in February but leading economists, including those within the government and at the Resolution Foundation think tank, have questioned the validity of its labour market data. Recruiters and employment consultancies told REC and KPMG researchers that fewer job opportunities also contributed to a rise in the number of people available for work. The broad survey also showed that month-on-month hiring activity has been slowing consecutively for two-and-a-half years. London was the only region to see recruitment pick up as a gap between the North and the capital city widened further. Vacancies also fell last month, with jobseekers looking for permanent positions more deeply affected. March was the 19th month in a row that demand for permanent staff had dropped. The figures are likely to come as a headache for Reeves as she seeks to reverse the UK’s low growth outlook and get people into work.REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: “Given the substantial effects of the government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.“Activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”Recruiters claimed there was a high demand for skills in various key service sectors including IT and accounting. The types of jobs recruiters claimed there were shortages in included financial analysts, auditors and software engineers. KPMG’s group chief executive Jon Holt said behaviour among employers had vastly changed as higher taxes and compliance with Labour’s controversial Employment Rights Bill were set to add to costs. “With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent,” he said. Holt added that there was little cause for optimism as President Trump’s tariffs could stir up a new storm for employers. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”https://lnkd.in/e_geHQcE

Chris RyanChris Ryan,,"Are you drowning in factory KPIs or frustrated about outdated dashboards? Let’s talk about taming that data zoo. 🦁🐘Tracking plant availability manually can be frustrating. It's even worse if you're always behind on reporting errors that have already passed. And what about the heaps of data you can't make sense of?Yesterday’s smart factory workshop with Next Industries and OCTOTRONIC tackled these challenges head-on. 🎉We got hands-on designing our own Unified Namespace (or UNS, for short). It's not perfect for every scenario, but WOW—it brings order to chaos. Proper contextualization for YOUR telemetry data is key.Some of the highlights:➡️ Ottmar Matthias Müller shared VAT's Smart Factory vision, including his Edge/ UNS Adapter Architecture.➡️ Tim Frech discussed avoiding KPI fatigue while making KPIs truly effective.➡️ Alexej Ziegler showed us how UNS tames chaotic data, making factory insights accessible.Thanks also Matthias Kühne for the - as always - excellent organization 👏Key takeaway? UNS forces you rethink how structure plant data from start. Clean, contextualized data empowers operators and sharpens decision-making to extract value out of their data WHEN they really need it.What’s your biggest data challenge right now? Have you tried implementing something like UNS or do you think this is overkill?Bonus pic: LEGO Smart Factory Pic 🏭 🚀

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug. I help businesses untangle their numbers and turn confusion into clarity.

When an issue shows up, they don’t want a brochure. They want: “Here’s what’s likely happening, and here’s what to do.”🧪 Formulas that don’t require guesswork. Give them port specific, dosage ready blends. If the crew has to trial and error your product, you’ve already failed.🔄 Less noise. More uptime. No unnecessary foam. No frequent reapplications. They want to set it, dose it, rinse it and move on.At RX Marine, we’ve spent years listening to crews, not just customers. That’s why every drum comes backed by data, support, and clear application logic.💬 If you're an engineer, what else would you want from a supplier that you wish they'd just understand?We’re listening.

Gemma KentishGemma Kentish,,"""More people were added to the large pool of jobseekers in March than at any point since the pandemic, according to recruiters, as high levels of redundancies are driving a “steeper rise” in staff availability. Employers have come under greater strain in the months since Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ announced a £25bn national insurance tax raid on firms, which came into effect last Sunday. Now a new joint survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG suggests that the jobs market took a turn for the worse in March. Redundancies drove the biggest rise in the number of jobseekers since late 2020, recruiters said, pointing to a likely deterioration in UK unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment levels held steady at 4.4 per cent in February but leading economists, including those within the government and at the Resolution Foundation think tank, have questioned the validity of its labour market data. Recruiters and employment consultancies told REC and KPMG researchers that fewer job opportunities also contributed to a rise in the number of people available for work. The broad survey also showed that month-on-month hiring activity has been slowing consecutively for two-and-a-half years. London was the only region to see recruitment pick up as a gap between the North and the capital city widened further. Vacancies also fell last month, with jobseekers looking for permanent positions more deeply affected. March was the 19th month in a row that demand for permanent staff had dropped. The figures are likely to come as a headache for Reeves as she seeks to reverse the UK’s low growth outlook and get people into work.REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: “Given the substantial effects of the government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.“Activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”Recruiters claimed there was a high demand for skills in various key service sectors including IT and accounting. The types of jobs recruiters claimed there were shortages in included financial analysts, auditors and software engineers. KPMG’s group chief executive Jon Holt said behaviour among employers had vastly changed as higher taxes and compliance with Labour’s controversial Employment Rights Bill were set to add to costs. “With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent,” he said. Holt added that there was little cause for optimism as President Trump’s tariffs could stir up a new storm for employers. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”https://lnkd.in/e_geHQcE

Chris RyanChris Ryan,,"Are you drowning in factory KPIs or frustrated about outdated dashboards? Let’s talk about taming that data zoo. 🦁🐘Tracking plant availability manually can be frustrating. It's even worse if you're always behind on reporting errors that have already passed. And what about the heaps of data you can't make sense of?Yesterday’s smart factory workshop with Next Industries and OCTOTRONIC tackled these challenges head-on. 🎉We got hands-on designing our own Unified Namespace (or UNS, for short). It's not perfect for every scenario, but WOW—it brings order to chaos. Proper contextualization for YOUR telemetry data is key.Some of the highlights:➡️ Ottmar Matthias Müller shared VAT's Smart Factory vision, including his Edge/ UNS Adapter Architecture.➡️ Tim Frech discussed avoiding KPI fatigue while making KPIs truly effective.➡️ Alexej Ziegler showed us how UNS tames chaotic data, making factory insights accessible.Thanks also Matthias Kühne for the - as always - excellent organization 👏Key takeaway? UNS forces you rethink how structure plant data from start. Clean, contextualized data empowers operators and sharpens decision-making to extract value out of their data WHEN they really need it.What’s your biggest data challenge right now? Have you tried implementing something like UNS or do you think this is overkill?Bonus pic: LEGO Smart Factory Pic 🏭 🚀

Chidinma Obianigwe.Chidinma Obianigwe.,,"Please don’t make the same mistake I madeTwo years ago, when I first learned data analytics, I felt I had arrivedI’d parade myself online with bold captions like: “I help businesses increase sales and revenue using data.”And then—boom! A business owner slid into my Linkedin DM . “Hi, I just started a business. Can you help me increase my sales?”I replied confidently, “Yes, I can. But I’ll need access to your business data.”He said, “I don’t have any data. My business is just new.”And just like that, I told him I couldn’t help. I thought I could only help him, if had his business data in tabulated format, so I can download and evaluate using Excel or other analytical tools Poor me. If only I knew.There’s a big difference between theory and real-life application. One of the first lessons in data analytics is data sourcing. I thought I understood it—until I didn’t.But guess what? Continuous learning helps a lot.I truly understood primary data during a UI/UX training I joined . We were told to generate data for a user research.That’s when it hit me hard.As a  data analyst, you may not have access to data, or you’re not always handed a clean dataset. You may have to create one from scratch.• Forms• Surveys• Polls• Quizzes• Interviews• Observations That’s how real-world insights are born.That man didn’t need someone to analyze a spreadsheet—he needed someone to help him collect data from the ground up. And that someone should’ve been me.If you’re learning data analytics, focus on real-world practice:• How to gather primary data• Where to find secondary data• How to ask the right questionsBecause businesses don’t always come with a ready-made dataset. 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️ 〰️Have you ever made a similar mistake? What would you do differently, in a similar situation?Let’s talk. I’m Chidinma Obianigwe.  --- a data strategist and your solution plug.

Workday WizardWorkday Wizard,,"Most Workday consultants don’t talk about this...But they should.The real pain begins when a company outgrows its Job Management setup in Workday.->At 50 employees, Job Management is agile.->At 5000 employees? It becomes a reporting nightmare.I’ve helped companies make the switch to Position Management and here’s what I’ve learned:->Switching is not “just a config change.”It’s an org-wide shift.Here’s how elite consultants do it (without breaking hiring or blowing up reporting):✅ Step 1: Business Alignment Audit your current model. Map hiring pain points to business needs. If Finance is frustrated with over-hiring, it's time to shift.✅ Step 2: Define the Rules Design “Create Position” and “Close Position” workflows. Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Set clear validation rules and approval paths.✅ Step 3: Configure in Sandbox Don’t skip this. Test Position Management with real data. Refine hiring restrictions—job profile, location, worker type.✅ Step 4: Pilot It First Choose one department. Roll out. Monitor KPIs like time-to-fill, compliance, and hiring manager satisfaction.✅ Step 5: Train Like Crazy Managers will resist change unless they know what’s in it for them. Create job aids. Hold live Q&As. Build support in Slack/Teams.✅ Step 6: Phase the Rollout Don’t flip the switch org-wide. Transition org by org. Monitor, tweak, and scale.✅ Step 7: Review + Improve Post-rollout audits are non-negotiable. Use Workday dashboards to measure what’s working—and where you need to iterate.🎯 Pro Tip: Align hiring restrictions to enforce budget discipline.Want only FT Engineers in London for a role?Make it impossible to break that rule in Workday.This is the difference between a Workday config specialist and a true Workday strategist.Your staffing model isn't static.It evolves as the business grows.And Workday has the tools to scale it...if you implement them right.Love this Workday bite?Join my Live 40-hour Workday HCM Course- Batch 80 starting 4th May.hashtag#workdayhcm hashtag#workdayconsultant hashtag#workdaytips hashtag#staffingstrategy hashtag#positionmanagement hashtag#jobmanagement hashtag#workdaytraining hashtag#hcmtransformation hashtag#hrtech hashtag#peopleoperations hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#talentstrategy hashtag#linkedinlearning

Gemma KentishGemma Kentish,,"""More people were added to the large pool of jobseekers in March than at any point since the pandemic, according to recruiters, as high levels of redundancies are driving a “steeper rise” in staff availability. Employers have come under greater strain in the months since Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ announced a £25bn national insurance tax raid on firms, which came into effect last Sunday. Now a new joint survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG suggests that the jobs market took a turn for the worse in March. Redundancies drove the biggest rise in the number of jobseekers since late 2020, recruiters said, pointing to a likely deterioration in UK unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment levels held steady at 4.4 per cent in February but leading economists, including those within the government and at the Resolution Foundation think tank, have questioned the validity of its labour market data. Recruiters and employment consultancies told REC and KPMG researchers that fewer job opportunities also contributed to a rise in the number of people available for work. The broad survey also showed that month-on-month hiring activity has been slowing consecutively for two-and-a-half years. London was the only region to see recruitment pick up as a gap between the North and the capital city widened further. Vacancies also fell last month, with jobseekers looking for permanent positions more deeply affected. March was the 19th month in a row that demand for permanent staff had dropped. The figures are likely to come as a headache for Reeves as she seeks to reverse the UK’s low growth outlook and get people into work.REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: “Given the substantial effects of the government’s decision to increase payroll taxes hugely, these figures were if anything slightly better than expected and suggest that there is potential in the market.“Activity in the UK jobs market has now been subdued for almost two and a half years.”Recruiters claimed there was a high demand for skills in various key service sectors including IT and accounting. The types of jobs recruiters claimed there were shortages in included financial analysts, auditors and software engineers. KPMG’s group chief executive Jon Holt said behaviour among employers had vastly changed as higher taxes and compliance with Labour’s controversial Employment Rights Bill were set to add to costs. “With cost management a focus, those employers who are hiring are focused on securing the best talent,” he said. Holt added that there was little cause for optimism as President Trump’s tariffs could stir up a new storm for employers. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”https://lnkd.in/e_geHQcE

Chris RyanChris Ryan,,"Are you drowning in factory KPIs or frustrated about outdated dashboards? Let’s talk about taming that data zoo. 🦁🐘Tracking plant availability manually can be frustrating. It's even worse if you're always behind on reporting errors that have already passed. And what about the heaps of data you can't make sense of?Yesterday’s smart factory workshop with Next Industries and OCTOTRONIC tackled these challenges head-on. 🎉We got hands-on designing our own Unified Namespace (or UNS, for short). It's not perfect for every scenario, but WOW—it brings order to chaos. Proper contextualization for YOUR telemetry data is key.Some of the highlights:➡️ Ottmar Matthias Müller shared VAT's Smart Factory vision, including his Edge/ UNS Adapter Architecture.➡️ Tim Frech discussed avoiding KPI fatigue while making KPIs truly effective.➡️ Alexej Ziegler showed us how UNS tames chaotic data, making factory insights accessible.Thanks also Matthias Kühne for the - as always - excellent organization 👏Key takeaway? UNS forces you rethink how structure plant data from start. Clean, contextualized data empowers operators and sharpens decision-making to extract value out of their data WHEN they really need it.What’s your biggest data challenge right now? Have you tried implementing something like UNS or do you think this is overkill?Bonus pic: LEGO Smart Factory Pic 🏭 🚀
