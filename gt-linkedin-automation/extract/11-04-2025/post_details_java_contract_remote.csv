Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

The challenge? Traditional batch-processing pipelines couldn’t detect anomalies before they impacted customers.🚨 The Problem:How can we design and deploy a scalable, low-latency fraud detection architecture that processes, evaluates, and acts on transaction data in real-time—under 300ms—with 99.99% availability, across multi-region deployments?💡 The Solution Architecture (Google Cloud):Data Ingestion at ScaleUsed Cloud Pub/Sub to stream millions of transactions/sec from multiple APIs & mobile clients.Integrated Cloud Load Balancer and Cloud Armor for DDoS protection and traffic distribution.Real-Time Processing and Anomaly DetectionBuilt a streaming pipeline with Dataflow (Apache Beam) to parse, transform, and route data.Integrated a TensorFlow model hosted on AI Platform to score transaction risk in-stream.Results pushed to Bigtable (low-latency NoSQL) and Firestore (for app sync).Action EngineWhen high-risk activity is detected:Trigger Cloud Functions to alert user & lock account.Log structured events to BigQuery for post-analysis.Notify fraud analysts via Pub/Sub → Slack bot integration.Observability & GovernanceUsed Cloud Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver) for end-to-end tracing.IAM & VPC SC policies enforced strict boundaries across services.🧠 Key Challenges Tackled:Model versioning in production with Vertex AI PipelinesMulti-region failover with Cloud SpannerMaintaining throughput SLA during burst traffic with autoscaling Dataflow jobs⚙️ Tech Stack Summary: Pub/Sub • Dataflow • Cloud Functions • Vertex AI • BigQuery • Cloud Spanner • Cloud Armor • IAM + VPC SC📊 Impact:Reduced fraud impact by 62% within first 2 monthsReal-time detection latency: < 200msEnabled real-time dashboards and model A/B testing🔥 Calling all cloud architects and engineers—how would you handle edge cases like model drift, data poisoning, or cost optimization in such a pipeline?Let’s talk design patterns, not just tools. 👇 hashtag#GoogleCloud hashtag#RealTimeML hashtag#StreamingData hashtag#Dataflow hashtag#VertexAI hashtag#CloudArchitecture hashtag#Fintech hashtag#FraudDetection hashtag#EventDrivenArchitecture hashtag#GCP hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#ScalableSystems

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource
