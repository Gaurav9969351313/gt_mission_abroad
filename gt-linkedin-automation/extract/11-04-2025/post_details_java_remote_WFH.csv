It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Seokmoon RyooSeokmoon Ryoo,,"예전에 원서로 읽어서 번역서의 존재를 모르고 있었는데 에이콘 출판사에서 2020년에 “디지털 트렌스포메이션 엔진”이란 제목으로 출판을 했네요. 좋은 개발 조직을 만들기 위해 고민하시는 분들께 추천합니다. 『Accelerate』 요약 및 추천의 말 (ChatGPT 작성)저자: Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim부제: Lean 소프트웨어 및 DevOps의 과학적 접근⸻이 책을 기술 리더에게 추천하는 이유기술 조직을 성장시키는 데 있어 빠르고 안정적인 소프트웨어 제공 역량은 더 이상 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.『Accelerate』는 수년간의 연구 데이터를 기반으로, 어떤 조직이 소프트웨어를 더 빠르고, 더 안정적으로, 더 유연하게 전달하고 있는지 그 공통된 특징과 실행 방법을 명확히 제시합니다.특히 이 책은 다음과 같은 질문을 가진 기술 리더에게 강력히 추천됩니다: •	“어떻게 하면 조직의 배포 속도와 품질을 동시에 높일 수 있을까?” •	“DevOps와 Lean 방법론은 구체적으로 어떤 결과를 만들 수 있을까?” •	“문화, 리더십, 기술 구조는 어떻게 연결되어야 지속적인 성장이 가능한가?”이 책은 막연한 ‘좋은 방법’이 아니라, 수치와 데이터로 검증된 구체적 실천 항목을 제공합니다.조직 성장을 고민하는 모든 기술 리더에게 강력한 나침반이 되어 줄 것입니다.⸻Accelerate 핵심 요약 (한국어)1. 소프트웨어 성과를 측정하는 네 가지 핵심 지표고성과 조직은 다음 네 가지 지표에서 두각을 나타냅니다: 1.	배포 빈도(Deployment Frequency) – 얼마나 자주 배포하는가 2.	변경 리드 타임(Lead Time for Changes) – 코드 작성부터 배포까지 걸리는 시간 3.	변경 실패율(Change Failure Rate) – 배포 후 장애가 발생하는 비율 4.	평균 복구 시간(MTTR) – 장애 발생 시 복구까지 걸리는 시간이 네 가지 지표는 조직의 소프트웨어 전달 역량을 가장 정확하게 설명합니다.⸻2. 성과를 높이는 기술적 실천 요소 •	지속적 통합 및 배포(CI/CD): 자동화된 테스트, 트렁크 기반 개발, 배포 자동화 등 •	인프라를 코드로 관리(Infrastructure as Code): 환경 구성 자동화 •	모니터링과 가시성 확보: 시스템 상태와 변화에 대한 실시간 피드백 •	결합도 낮은 아키텍처: 팀 간 의존성 최소화로 빠른 배포 가능⸻3. 조직 문화와 리더십의 역할기술만큼이나 중요한 것이 조직 문화입니다.성과가 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 특징을 공유합니다: •	작업 시각화: 칸반 등으로 업무 흐름을 명확히 함 •	WIP 제한: 동시에 진행하는 업무를 줄여 효율 향상 •	피드백 주기 단축: 빠르게 실험하고 배우는 문화 •	심리적 안전감: 실패에 대한 처벌보다 학습에 초점을 둔 분위기이러한 문화는 단기간에 만들어지지 않으며, 리더의 행동과 태도에서 시작됩니다.⸻4. 고성과 조직의 비즈니스 효과소프트웨어 전달 역량이 높은 조직은 다음과 같은 성과로 이어집니다: •	수익성과 시장 점유율 상승 •	고객 만족도 향상 •	직원 만족도 및 유지율 증가즉, 기술 조직의 고도화는 단지 IT 부서의 개선을 넘어서, 기업 전체의 경쟁력 강화로 직결됩니다.⸻핵심 메시지『Accelerate』는 다음과 같은 메시지를 명확히 전달합니다:“소프트웨어 전달 성과는 측정할 수 있고, 개선할 수 있으며, 궁극적으로 조직의 성패를 좌우한다.”기술, 문화, 리더십이 유기적으로 연결될 때 비로소 진정한 지속 가능하고 고성능의 조직으로 거듭날 수 있습니다.

It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills.

It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Alka ElizabethAlka Elizabeth,,"Just before DrupalCon Atlanta, I caught up with Pierre Dureau—yes, that Pierre from UI Suite. We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Alka ElizabethAlka Elizabeth,,"Just before DrupalCon Atlanta, I caught up with Pierre Dureau—yes, that Pierre from UI Suite. We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times. The full transcript is out now.Video’s on the way.https://lnkd.in/gU4RZgpm hashtag#Drupal hashtag#DisplayBuilder hashtag#UIDesign hashtag#UISuite

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

"George Carrington, MSc. EdGeorge Carrington, MSc. Ed",,"💡 ""From blinking LEDs to intelligent systems — the journey begins with a spark.""As an educator exploring the intersection of STEM and Design, I recently guided students through PWM-based LED fading using an Arduino-compatible board. Beyond circuits and code, this activity lit up a conversation about feedback loops, system control, and how embedded intelligence transforms the simplest components into powerful learning tools.Robotics and microcontroller programming are no longer fringe topics — they're the language of innovation across Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Design Technology.

We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects? Let me know how it helped!hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Encapsulation hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Programming hashtag#JavaLearning

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Alka ElizabethAlka Elizabeth,,"Just before DrupalCon Atlanta, I caught up with Pierre Dureau—yes, that Pierre from UI Suite. We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

VENKAT DHEERAJ KVENKAT DHEERAJ K,,"🚀 Building My Own Kernel from Scratch: Progress UpdateFor the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into low-level systems development — writing a 32-bit kernel from scratch. No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support. Then — security hardening, because I’m coming for the kernel-level security side next 🔥📂 Code is open-source: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gq3xk_KtIf you're also into low-level, systems programming, or reverse engineering — let’s connect!hashtag#OperatingSystems hashtag#KernelDev hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#ReverseEngineering hashtag#CProgramming hashtag#x86 hashtag#LowLevel hashtag#SystemsProgramming hashtag#OpenSource

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

AND if a job can be done (and done well) virtually, then the upsides are endless both for the person and the work itself. I’m better at HR because I WFH.

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

No frameworks. No OS underneath. Just raw hardware, C, and assembly.🔧 Here's what I've built and understood so far:🧠 Booted from Real Mode into Protected Mode (with paging disabled)🔓 Enabled the A20 line and set up proper memory access🛠️ Built a custom cross-compiler toolchain to compile C code for the kernel💾 Loaded my 32-bit kernel with proper debug symbols🧼 Cleaned up object files and aligned sections properly for safe execution🧵 Set up VGA text mode and wrote a basic text output driver🔗 Wrote and registered my own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)⏱️ Programmed the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and timer IRQ📦 Started building my own heap allocator from scratch⚙️ Added an enable_interrupts() syscall to prepare for multitasking📚 This journey isn’t just about OS dev — it’s about really understanding how CPUs, memory, interrupts, and hardware communication work under the hood. It’s been a massive level-up in C, assembly, and systems thinking.Next goals: Paging, Threading, basic scheduler, and eventually user-space support.

Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

Alka ElizabethAlka Elizabeth,,"Just before DrupalCon Atlanta, I caught up with Pierre Dureau—yes, that Pierre from UI Suite. We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times. The full transcript is out now.Video’s on the way.https://lnkd.in/gU4RZgpm hashtag#Drupal hashtag#DisplayBuilder hashtag#UIDesign hashtag#UISuite

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

(I think at this point I’ve gone feral 😆)I am living proof that the unbiased studies about remote work are accurate. Not all jobs can be remote, which is a very important distinction. AND if a job can be done (and done well) virtually, then the upsides are endless both for the person and the work itself. I’m better at HR because I WFH. I’m able to be a better worker, partner, mother, community member and friend because I WFH.

Ajithkumar DharmarAjithkumar Dharmar,,"🚀 Abstract Class vs Interface in Java – Real-Life Analogy + Code!Ever get confused about when to use an abstract class vs an interface in Java? 🤔 Here’s an easy way to understand it — with a real-world analogy:🎯 Analogy: Vehicle 🚗 + Flying Capability ✈️Abstract Class (Vehicle): Think of a Vehicle as a blueprint for common things like car, bike, or bus. All vehicles have some shared features (like wheels, engine), but each has its own implementation too. So, Vehicle is a perfect abstract class.Interface (Flyable): Now, some vehicles (like a drone or helicopter) can fly. That’s a capability, not something every vehicle has. So, we use an interface for that.💡 Code Example:// Abstract classabstract class Vehicle { String brand; Vehicle(String brand) { this.brand = brand; } void startEngine() { System.out.println(brand + "" engine started.""); } abstract void move();}// Interfaceinterface Flyable { void fly();}// Car class extends Vehicleclass Car extends Vehicle { Car(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is driving on the road.""); }}// Drone class extends Vehicle and implements Flyableclass Drone extends Vehicle implements Flyable { Drone(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is moving in the air.""); } @Override public void fly() { System.out.println(brand + "" is flying.""); }}public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Car car = new Car(""Tesla""); car.startEngine(); car.move(); Drone drone = new Drone(""DJI""); drone.startEngine(); drone.move(); drone.fly(); }}📌 Pro Tip: Use abstract classes for generalization (shared behavior), and interfaces for flexibility (shared capabilities across unrelated classes).hashtag#Java hashtag#ObjectOrientedProgramming hashtag#AbstractClass hashtag#Interface hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#RealLifeAnalogy hashtag#InterviewReady hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#JavaProgramming hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#JavaInterview

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access. You're building safe APIs, not walls.👉 Have you used encapsulation in your projects?

Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

"George Carrington, MSc. EdGeorge Carrington, MSc. Ed",,"💡 ""From blinking LEDs to intelligent systems — the journey begins with a spark.""As an educator exploring the intersection of STEM and Design, I recently guided students through PWM-based LED fading using an Arduino-compatible board. Beyond circuits and code, this activity lit up a conversation about feedback loops, system control, and how embedded intelligence transforms the simplest components into powerful learning tools.Robotics and microcontroller programming are no longer fringe topics — they're the language of innovation across Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Design Technology. My mission? To empower students to become the next generation of systems thinkers and problem solvers, not just consumers of tech.Let’s connect and build a future where every classroom becomes a launchpad for intelligent design.// Use a PWM-capable pin for fading the LEDint myLEDPIN = 9; void setup() { // Initialize the LED pin as an output pinMode(myLEDPIN, OUTPUT);}void loop() { // Fade up (increase brightness) for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) { analogWrite(myLEDPIN, brightness); // Set LED brightness delay(10);             // Small delay for smooth fading } // Fade down (decrease brightness) for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) { analogWrite(myLEDPIN, brightness); // Set LED brightness delay(10);             // Small delay for smooth fading } // Optional pause between cycles delay(1000);}🔗 hashtag#STEMEducation hashtag#InternationalSchools hashtag#DesignThinking hashtag#EdTechLeadership hashtag#FutureReadySkills hashtag#ArduinoProjects hashtag#IBDesign hashtag#EngineeringEducation hashtag#RoboticsInEducation hashtag#TechIntegration hashtag#GlobalEducators hashtag#EducationRecruitment hashtag#MicrocontrollersInClassroom hashtag#LinkedInEducators

Alka ElizabethAlka Elizabeth,,"Just before DrupalCon Atlanta, I caught up with Pierre Dureau—yes, that Pierre from UI Suite. We talked shop on design systems, frontend workflows, and somewhere in between, he casually dropped that he’s working on a new Display Builder for Drupal.Not a tweak. A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite. All that was missing was a proper UI layer. They’ve started building it, and honestly, it sounds like it could change a lot for site builders and themers alike.This was part of a longer convo for The Drop Times.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

AND if a job can be done (and done well) virtually, then the upsides are endless both for the person and the work itself. I’m better at HR because I WFH.

Ajithkumar DharmarAjithkumar Dharmar,,"🚀 Abstract Class vs Interface in Java – Real-Life Analogy + Code!Ever get confused about when to use an abstract class vs an interface in Java? 🤔 Here’s an easy way to understand it — with a real-world analogy:🎯 Analogy: Vehicle 🚗 + Flying Capability ✈️Abstract Class (Vehicle): Think of a Vehicle as a blueprint for common things like car, bike, or bus. All vehicles have some shared features (like wheels, engine), but each has its own implementation too. So, Vehicle is a perfect abstract class.Interface (Flyable): Now, some vehicles (like a drone or helicopter) can fly. That’s a capability, not something every vehicle has. So, we use an interface for that.💡 Code Example:// Abstract classabstract class Vehicle { String brand; Vehicle(String brand) { this.brand = brand; } void startEngine() { System.out.println(brand + "" engine started.""); } abstract void move();}// Interfaceinterface Flyable { void fly();}// Car class extends Vehicleclass Car extends Vehicle { Car(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is driving on the road.""); }}// Drone class extends Vehicle and implements Flyableclass Drone extends Vehicle implements Flyable { Drone(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is moving in the air.""); } @Override public void fly() { System.out.println(brand + "" is flying.""); }}public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Car car = new Car(""Tesla""); car.startEngine(); car.move(); Drone drone = new Drone(""DJI""); drone.startEngine(); drone.move(); drone.fly(); }}📌 Pro Tip: Use abstract classes for generalization (shared behavior), and interfaces for flexibility (shared capabilities across unrelated classes).hashtag#Java hashtag#ObjectOrientedProgramming hashtag#AbstractClass hashtag#Interface hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#RealLifeAnalogy hashtag#InterviewReady hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#JavaProgramming hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#JavaInterview

Gary S.Gary S.,,"I had another very productive day at Experian today. Thursday is our collaboration day, so there’s a lot more people to meet with face to face. I’m really enjoying planning Thursdays around in-person activities. We also had some wonderful lunch catered in and music to chill out to in the courtyard. We can be productive working remote, and that works for many people. For me, it can feel a little isolating. Sometimes I write with my door open so I can hear the chickens next door talking. Sometimes I will drive around the block to Woody’s Diner so I can hear the ladies yell “Hey Gary” when I walk in. Sometimes I can go an entire day without talking to another person, depending on what I am working on, so I view these opportunities to collaborate in person at work as a gift. What do you think?  Do you miss the office the way it was in the before times?

Ratna AroraRatna Arora,,"""Interpersonal Skills in the Age of Remote Work: What Truly Matters Now?""As we move further into remote work, there’s one thing that’s clear: Interpersonal skills are no longer just “nice-to-haves” — they’re the foundation of success in this digital age.In a world where we often see nothing more than tiny Zoom boxes, our interpersonal skills are the glue that holds teams together and fuels collaboration.But here's the truth: Remote work isn’t just about communicating more often. It’s about communicating better, with more intention, empathy, and emotional intelligence.So, what interpersonal skills matter most now? hashtag#Intentional Communication Clarity is king when words are your only tool. Remote work demands that we speak with precision and listen with intent. It's about being deliberate in every message, call, and interaction. In this setting, miscommunication is costly. How can you ensure your messages hit home every time?hashtag#DigitalEmpathy Empathy used to mean picking up on body language and tone in face-to-face meetings. Now, it’s about reading between the lines of a Slack message or noticing when someone’s voice cracks during a Zoom call. It’s about checking in when you sense something is off — and making sure people feel heard, even if you can't see them in person.hashtag#BuildingConnection, Not Just Tasks Remote work often isolates us in silos, making it harder to bond with colleagues. But you can still cultivate connection. It’s the quick “How’s your day going?” in between meetings. It’s the 5-minute virtual coffee chat that isn’t about work. It’s the human touch that can’t be replicated by just exchanging tasks.hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence Across Digital Spaces It’s one thing to manage emotions in person, but it’s a whole new level of skill when you can’t see someone’s face. High emotional intelligence in remote settings means knowing when someone’s stressed without them saying it. It’s about responding with tact, adapting to others' moods, and bringing out the best in your virtual team.hashtag#Trust Without Proximity Trust isn’t built by simply being in the same room anymore. It’s built by consistently delivering results, following through, and communicating openly. In remote work, trust becomes the invisible force that allows teams to collaborate effectively, even when they’re miles apart.Remote work demands more than just technical proficiency — it requires strong interpersonal skills. These skills don’t just make you a better colleague or leader; they make your entire team stronger and more cohesive.💬 What’s the most important interpersonal skill you’ve relied on in remote work? hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#InterpersonalSkills hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#DigitalCommunication hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#VirtualTeams hashtag#WorkplaceCulture

Sudarshan ChavanSudarshan Chavan,,"Day 10: Encapsulation in Java – Data Hiding & Access ControlEncapsulation is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Think of it like putting all your valuables in a safe — you control who gets access and how.In Java, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class — and restricting direct access to some components.🔐 Why Encapsulation?1. Hides internal implementation2. Protects data from unwanted modification3. Increases code maintainability4. Makes code more modular and secure✅Real-life Example: Think of a smartphone. You use apps, take photos, and make calls — but you don’t see how the circuits or memory work inside. Java classes are similar — they expose clean, simple methods while hiding internal complexity.👨‍💻 How it's done in Java?1️⃣ Declare class variables as private2️⃣ Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update themclass Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }}✅Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers:1. private → Accessible only within the same class2. default (no modifier) → Accessible within the same package3. protected → Accessible in the same package and subclasses4. public → Accessible from everywhere📌 Encapsulation isn’t just about hiding — it’s about controlled access.

Stefan HusanuStefan Husanu,,"Too many people think hybrid work won’t change when times get tough.But what happens when the economy dips? Companies tighten their grip.This chart, shared by Nick Bloom, shows what happens to workplace flexibility during a recession:Fully in-person work slightly increased.Fully remote work saw a small dip. Hybrid work saw minor shifts.3 - 4 days at the office remained stable. 1 - 2 days at the office declined. When uncertainty rises, companies default to control.Even if it hurts them long term.The assumption?“If they’re in the office, they’re working.”The reality?Forcing people back doesn’t drive results.It weakens morale and increases turnover.Employees want flexibility and they’ll leave to get it.Research proves:Hybrid work leads to happier, healthier employees.Turnover drops when employees have flexibility.Companies that maintain hybrid models gain a competitive edge.I’ll leave you with this thought:Recessions don’t kill flexible work.Rigid leadership does.Image credit: Nick Bloom.👉 Follow me, Stefan Husanu, for more content like this.♻️ Share this post with your network today.

A whole new take.Think: a clean, modern, design-system-native alternative to Layout Builder, Page Layout, and even Views (for display). No preprocess hooks, no business logic in the theme, just structured UI powered by HTMX, Web Components, and deep Drupal integration.He said they’ve already built 80% of the engine through UI Suite.

Pouya GbPouya Gb,,"Low-Level, High-Performance: Custom RPC + Shared Memory in ActionIn one of the low-level projects I worked on, the core challenge was designing an ultra-fast and efficient communication layer between the frontend and backend, both implemented in pure C.Given the strict requirements for low latency and high throughput, conventional solutions like REST or WebSocket were simply not viable—they introduced unacceptable overhead for our use case.To achieve optimal performance, we adopted a hybrid approach using a custom RPC mechanism alongside Shared Memory IPC.- The RPC layer was implemented as a lightweight, protocol-agnostic system operating entirely in user space, enabling direct, method-level communication between the two C modules. - For heavy or high-frequency data exchange, we used memory-mapped files and shared buffer regions, effectively bypassing the need for serialization and minimizing data copy overhead.With a carefully designed memory layout, lock-free data structures, and synchronization handled via atomic operations, we built a stable, real-time, and highly efficient communication pipeline.This experience reinforced a valuable lesson: when system-level performance is critical, it’s worth moving beyond standard abstractions and handcrafting communication just as thoughtfully as the rest of the architecture.

Susan Ann RoySusan Ann Roy,,"<not CHATGPT, own writeup ✍️>Here is the detailed circuit diagram of the controller board. The entire system is divided into various subsystems such as the solar, wind, battery and the load. The energy produced by the solar and wind can be directly used to power the load or can be stored in the battery for future use. The Solar system uses an MPPT (P&O algorithm) for maximizing power output using duty cycle of buck converter adjusting using PWM pulses from microcontroller. Series blocking diodes were placed to block reverse flow of currents and overvoltage protection systems were also deployed to stop charging of battery when full. The load was a 10W 12V DC bulb available in car indicators and the battery was a 12V  7Ah battery available in UPS inverters. At the heart of our IoT architecture, lies our ESP32 which has in-built wifi connectivity. Sensors are used to collect data from all these subsystems and give it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and displays it on the computer screen. The website was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data was sent using $GET request through a URL string, extracted and stored in a JSON file in the backend side using PHP and was sent to the webpage. AJAX was used to refresh data continuously, without reloading the entire page. JQUERY was used to update the tables using the given data. The current measurement system uses an ACS712 Hall effect sensor and voltage measurement uses potential divider networks. The supply for the sensors were drawn from low voltage regulators connected to 12V sources within the system. Relays and darlington pair transistor ICs were used for condition based switching. Programmable voltage regulators were used for Wind turbines. Vertical axis wind turbines and designed to be omnidirectional, easily maintainable and for low wind speeds. Speaking about the wind turbines, we have used a microturbine using the Savonius model. Savonius turbines are self staring, run at low residential wind speeds, produce less noise, but have low power coefficients. Darius turbines have good power coefficients but cannot run at low wind speeds and are not self starting. At first we had designed a hybrid model of S&D design that combines the self staring capability of Savonius design and high power coefficient of Darius. Later we switched on to this model, due to unavailability of proper funding resources, proving that it is scalable to higher levels. Ultrasonic sensors were used for motion detection and smart control.

"Rachel DeFoe Newton, SHRM-SCPRachel DeFoe Newton, SHRM-SCP",,"Today is apparently Global Work From Home Day, and I’m here for it 👩🏻‍💻Remote work continues to evolve, but one thing is certain, I won’t ever go fully in person again - at least not while working in the same field. (I think at this point I’ve gone feral 😆)I am living proof that the unbiased studies about remote work are accurate. Not all jobs can be remote, which is a very important distinction. AND if a job can be done (and done well) virtually, then the upsides are endless both for the person and the work itself. I’m better at HR because I WFH. I’m able to be a better worker, partner, mother, community member and friend because I WFH. I get the “return to office” fad, but I’ll pass and feel incredibly fortunate to work for a company that sees the values in a remote ecosystem.

Ajithkumar DharmarAjithkumar Dharmar,,"🚀 Abstract Class vs Interface in Java – Real-Life Analogy + Code!Ever get confused about when to use an abstract class vs an interface in Java? 🤔 Here’s an easy way to understand it — with a real-world analogy:🎯 Analogy: Vehicle 🚗 + Flying Capability ✈️Abstract Class (Vehicle): Think of a Vehicle as a blueprint for common things like car, bike, or bus. All vehicles have some shared features (like wheels, engine), but each has its own implementation too. So, Vehicle is a perfect abstract class.Interface (Flyable): Now, some vehicles (like a drone or helicopter) can fly. That’s a capability, not something every vehicle has. So, we use an interface for that.💡 Code Example:// Abstract classabstract class Vehicle { String brand; Vehicle(String brand) { this.brand = brand; } void startEngine() { System.out.println(brand + "" engine started.""); } abstract void move();}// Interfaceinterface Flyable { void fly();}// Car class extends Vehicleclass Car extends Vehicle { Car(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is driving on the road.""); }}// Drone class extends Vehicle and implements Flyableclass Drone extends Vehicle implements Flyable { Drone(String brand) { super(brand); } @Override void move() { System.out.println(brand + "" is moving in the air.""); } @Override public void fly() { System.out.println(brand + "" is flying.""); }}public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Car car = new Car(""Tesla""); car.startEngine(); car.move(); Drone drone = new Drone(""DJI""); drone.startEngine(); drone.move(); drone.fly(); }}📌 Pro Tip: Use abstract classes for generalization (shared behavior), and interfaces for flexibility (shared capabilities across unrelated classes).hashtag#Java hashtag#ObjectOrientedProgramming hashtag#AbstractClass hashtag#Interface hashtag#CodingTips hashtag#RealLifeAnalogy hashtag#InterviewReady hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#JavaProgramming hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#JavaInterview

Gary S.Gary S.,,"I had another very productive day at Experian today. Thursday is our collaboration day, so there’s a lot more people to meet with face to face. I’m really enjoying planning Thursdays around in-person activities. We also had some wonderful lunch catered in and music to chill out to in the courtyard. We can be productive working remote, and that works for many people. For me, it can feel a little isolating. Sometimes I write with my door open so I can hear the chickens next door talking. Sometimes I will drive around the block to Woody’s Diner so I can hear the ladies yell “Hey Gary” when I walk in. Sometimes I can go an entire day without talking to another person, depending on what I am working on, so I view these opportunities to collaborate in person at work as a gift. What do you think?  Do you miss the office the way it was in the before times?
