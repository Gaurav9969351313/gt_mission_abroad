Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team.

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

Darren KwokDarren Kwok,,"To the hashtag#LinkedIn universeMe :""What could some transferrable possibilities? What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice. But like Karen Finerman said, “Waiting isn’t a life plan.” We don’t leave growth to chance—we build the conditions for it and you drive your own career narrative.So—what’s a skill or idea you’ve never put on a resume… but just might change everything?👇 Drop your favorite or add your own comments!

Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice. But like Karen Finerman said, “Waiting isn’t a life plan.” We don’t leave growth to chance—we build the conditions for it and you drive your own career narrative.So—what’s a skill or idea you’ve never put on a resume… but just might change everything?👇 Drop your favorite or add your own comments!

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice.

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants? To be honest, I’m a little surprised we’re not seeing it as much yet. 🤔hashtag#TheNewSoftwareEngineers hashtag#Accounting hashtag#GoAccountants hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#AccountantShortage

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants? To be honest, I’m a little surprised we’re not seeing it as much yet. 🤔hashtag#TheNewSoftwareEngineers hashtag#Accounting hashtag#GoAccountants hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#AccountantShortage

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants?

Darren KwokDarren Kwok,,"To the hashtag#LinkedIn universeMe :""What could some transferrable possibilities? What are some of your career goals and you may just be willing to bridge the gap?""Not every Engineering career move comes with a map. Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team. Six months later? You’re shaping how we prototype and navigate possibilities and real-world use📍 No E-Powertrain experience? That didn’t stop a electro-mechanical engineer from pitching a battery with cooling system to customers.Serendipity is nice. But like Karen Finerman said, “Waiting isn’t a life plan.” We don’t leave growth to chance—we build the conditions for it and you drive your own career narrative.So—what’s a skill or idea you’ve never put on a resume… but just might change everything?👇 Drop your favorite or add your own comments!

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants?

Some start with a ‘why not?’At some companies, options are open and that company don't hire for perfect fits—we back people who thrive in ambiguity, ask sharper questions, and treat detours as design features.📍 You might start shadowing a systems team.

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

But I’ve learned that the best hires, the best teams, and the best results come when people are supported both in and outside of work.At Rent A Recruiter Australia, we believe in sustainable success — where productivity doesn’t come at the cost of well-being. I'm grateful to be part of a team that values boundaries, encourages flexibility, and recognizes that rest is productive too.Let’s normalize checking in with ourselves, setting limits, and creating space to recharge. It’s not just good for us — it’s good for business.Wishing everyone a great weekend!! 🙂 hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#RecruiterLife hashtag#TalentPartner hashtag#PeopleFirst hashtag#EmployeeWellbeing hashtag#MentalHealthAtWork hashtag#RentARecruiter hashtag#SustainableSuccess hashtag#WorkCulture

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants? To be honest, I’m a little surprised we’re not seeing it as much yet. 🤔hashtag#TheNewSoftwareEngineers hashtag#Accounting hashtag#GoAccountants hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#AccountantShortage

Why HR?】雨季來臨，潮濕泥濘的天氣，讓人們不得不放慢腳步，緩步前行👣。而陰雨連綿的天氣對我來說，是一個適合與自己獨處，回想過去、暢想未來的時間💭。週末時，去了一直想去但總沒時間前往的咖啡廳，點了一杯咖啡☕，看著杯中熱氣緩緩升起，我的記憶，回到了 hashtag#2021年 的夏天..hashtag#2021年 的夏天，仍在就讀大學的我，決定報考 hashtag#HR 相關的研究所! 作出這個決定時，同學及朋友都對我的決定表示不解:❓友人A: Simon, 你可以跟我說你為甚麼想讀人資所嗎?💡我的回答: 會對於 hashtag#HR 領域感到好奇是個偶然的機遇。大三的人力資源管理課程中，需製作一份完整的HRM報告。該份報告須從無到有創立一間新創公司並包含以下內容(e.g., 公司產業與背景、組織架構、未來發展方向等等)🏬。我主要負責區塊為HR選訓育用留等function的制度建置及後續優化，對於從未觸碰過HR領域的我，只能透過多方請教專業人才及個人累積的學術知識，成功完成該份報告🫡。這樣的經歷，也讓我對 hashtag#HR 領域產生高度興趣並願意在這條上長期發展，也同時是我想成為 hashtag#HR 專業人才，最初的motivation🙆‍♂️。hashtag#2022年 ，如願考上人資所的我，仍舊能聽到一些質疑聲，不外乎是針對該領域人員不需要讀研究所這點提出質疑:❓友人B: Simon, 你覺得你讀這個碩士值得嗎，有沒有其他更好的發展方向?🔥我的回答-嗯..沒有所謂值不值得吧，每個人的想法不同，價值觀也不同。就讀人資所主要有兩個原因:1️⃣宏觀-公司面: 希望自己能夠具備 hashtag#HR 領域充足的學術知識及素養，在公司遇到HR領域相關的問題時，可以適時提出想法建議，讓企業能夠往更好的未來持續邁進。2️⃣微觀-個人面: hashtag#HR 學術領域範圍既廣且深，想在這博大精深的地方，找出適合且喜歡的研究領域，持續鑽研，並能夠透過自身專業協助優秀人才找到適合自己的工作。hashtag#2024年 研究所畢業之後，對於不了解 hashtag#HR 的人來說，我們的工作可能是易如反掌且沒有技術含量的。也總會在日常生活中不經意聽到一些刺耳話語:❓友人C: Simon, hashtag#HR 不就是幫忙找人嗎再丟履歷給主管嗎，你何必讓自己做得這麼累?🔥我的回答: 其實不單單只是找履歷丟履歷而已，而是一種橋樑的角色。真正能夠讓我堅持下去的，是""find the guy that we need""的成就感🪴。hashtag#HR 工作是一個可以不斷接觸到不同領域、不同專業人才的絕佳管道，也能持續更新產業相關知識並了解企業人才需求，對於喜歡不斷學習新知識的我來說，這正是我想要，也剛好是我擅長的領域😁。也正是因為這些，我才會堅持，繼續走這條路。也希望自己能走到，退休的那一天😇。✍動機總結與個人體悟:""喜歡與人互動，幫助人選找到適合的位置""這句話，是數年前回覆給不理解我選擇 hashtag#HR 作為職涯的人們所說的一句話。幾年後重新回顧，這句話依然重要，但也發現對於目前的我來說，這只是想成為#HR 動機中的一小部分罷了🤣。絕大部分的原因是疊加在上述那句話上的，透過必要性的與人互動接觸，了解同業乃至其他主流產業對於人才與所需技能的需求，以此持續拓展對產業的理解與判斷未來趨勢的能力✍。從安排一場面試、人才媒合，到從 hashtag#HR 的角度出發參與企業未來策略布局，若能精準快速地掌握不同領域的發展脈動，就能見微知著，從人才需求中看見企業策略，從市場變化中洞察產業未來🔍。這段 hashtag#HR 旅程，走得並不算順利，但每個工作上遇到的挑戰，都成為我的養分，也讓我更加篤定，選擇 hashtag#HR 做為長期發展的職涯領域是正確的。也許多年後的我，會感謝現在的自己對於工作及理想的追求吧💪。hashtag#2025年 的四月，從記憶中回到了現實中，杯中的咖啡仍尚留一點餘溫。仍未完全從回憶中抽離的我，拿起咖啡淺嚐了一口，耶珈雪啡苦中帶酸的味道在口中蔓延，此時此刻發現，這杯咖啡的味道，其實跟生活挺像的🧩。苦中帶酸，略帶甜味，稱不上滑潤順口。但也因為這些層次，讓咖啡，更有味道，更有一再回味的價值☺️。如果現在的你，正在思考職涯的下一步，不妨給自己一些喘息的空間，讓自己有時間去更清楚地了解，真正想做的事情是什麼✨。新一輪的 hashtag#Hiring 也在持續進行中，給大家分享更多好職缺，一起為了心中理想的職涯和生活而努力吧🌞!🔎本次招募職缺: 💡Slot連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/g984YJRi💡背板連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具8年或以上連接器相關產品設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/gCaxDXF9💡車用連接器研發工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g8FPECwd💡Cable資深研發工程師/研發主管 (派駐廣州 / 大學以上學歷 / 具高頻高速線纜產品5年以上設計開發經驗 / 具研發專案團隊領導經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/gwJ5e8zW💡金屬材料研發人員 (派駐廣州 / 材料or化學相關博士學歷 / 無經驗可 / 具獨立進行學術研究能力者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g_rzemzQ💡高分子研發工程師 (派駐廣州 / 碩士以上學歷 / 無經驗可)🔗https://lnkd.in/gZJKVGGh💡高分子/材料工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 1年以上相關工作經歷)🔗https://lnkd.in/gmnT87q8若對以上外派RD職缺有興趣，歡迎透過以下方式與我聯繫或直接站內信給我，謝謝😌! 💼Contact infos:📲0983528361;📤simonho0325@lotestech.com。

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants?

Simon HoSimon Ho,simonho0325@lotestech.com,"hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#LOTES hashtag#Alwaysconnecting 【Motivation? Why HR?】雨季來臨，潮濕泥濘的天氣，讓人們不得不放慢腳步，緩步前行👣。而陰雨連綿的天氣對我來說，是一個適合與自己獨處，回想過去、暢想未來的時間💭。週末時，去了一直想去但總沒時間前往的咖啡廳，點了一杯咖啡☕，看著杯中熱氣緩緩升起，我的記憶，回到了 hashtag#2021年 的夏天..hashtag#2021年 的夏天，仍在就讀大學的我，決定報考 hashtag#HR 相關的研究所! 作出這個決定時，同學及朋友都對我的決定表示不解:❓友人A: Simon, 你可以跟我說你為甚麼想讀人資所嗎?💡我的回答: 會對於 hashtag#HR 領域感到好奇是個偶然的機遇。大三的人力資源管理課程中，需製作一份完整的HRM報告。該份報告須從無到有創立一間新創公司並包含以下內容(e.g., 公司產業與背景、組織架構、未來發展方向等等)🏬。我主要負責區塊為HR選訓育用留等function的制度建置及後續優化，對於從未觸碰過HR領域的我，只能透過多方請教專業人才及個人累積的學術知識，成功完成該份報告🫡。這樣的經歷，也讓我對 hashtag#HR 領域產生高度興趣並願意在這條上長期發展，也同時是我想成為 hashtag#HR 專業人才，最初的motivation🙆‍♂️。hashtag#2022年 ，如願考上人資所的我，仍舊能聽到一些質疑聲，不外乎是針對該領域人員不需要讀研究所這點提出質疑:❓友人B: Simon, 你覺得你讀這個碩士值得嗎，有沒有其他更好的發展方向?🔥我的回答-嗯..沒有所謂值不值得吧，每個人的想法不同，價值觀也不同。就讀人資所主要有兩個原因:1️⃣宏觀-公司面: 希望自己能夠具備 hashtag#HR 領域充足的學術知識及素養，在公司遇到HR領域相關的問題時，可以適時提出想法建議，讓企業能夠往更好的未來持續邁進。2️⃣微觀-個人面: hashtag#HR 學術領域範圍既廣且深，想在這博大精深的地方，找出適合且喜歡的研究領域，持續鑽研，並能夠透過自身專業協助優秀人才找到適合自己的工作。hashtag#2024年 研究所畢業之後，對於不了解 hashtag#HR 的人來說，我們的工作可能是易如反掌且沒有技術含量的。也總會在日常生活中不經意聽到一些刺耳話語:❓友人C: Simon, hashtag#HR 不就是幫忙找人嗎再丟履歷給主管嗎，你何必讓自己做得這麼累?🔥我的回答: 其實不單單只是找履歷丟履歷而已，而是一種橋樑的角色。真正能夠讓我堅持下去的，是""find the guy that we need""的成就感🪴。hashtag#HR 工作是一個可以不斷接觸到不同領域、不同專業人才的絕佳管道，也能持續更新產業相關知識並了解企業人才需求，對於喜歡不斷學習新知識的我來說，這正是我想要，也剛好是我擅長的領域😁。也正是因為這些，我才會堅持，繼續走這條路。也希望自己能走到，退休的那一天😇。✍動機總結與個人體悟:""喜歡與人互動，幫助人選找到適合的位置""這句話，是數年前回覆給不理解我選擇 hashtag#HR 作為職涯的人們所說的一句話。幾年後重新回顧，這句話依然重要，但也發現對於目前的我來說，這只是想成為#HR 動機中的一小部分罷了🤣。絕大部分的原因是疊加在上述那句話上的，透過必要性的與人互動接觸，了解同業乃至其他主流產業對於人才與所需技能的需求，以此持續拓展對產業的理解與判斷未來趨勢的能力✍。從安排一場面試、人才媒合，到從 hashtag#HR 的角度出發參與企業未來策略布局，若能精準快速地掌握不同領域的發展脈動，就能見微知著，從人才需求中看見企業策略，從市場變化中洞察產業未來🔍。這段 hashtag#HR 旅程，走得並不算順利，但每個工作上遇到的挑戰，都成為我的養分，也讓我更加篤定，選擇 hashtag#HR 做為長期發展的職涯領域是正確的。也許多年後的我，會感謝現在的自己對於工作及理想的追求吧💪。hashtag#2025年 的四月，從記憶中回到了現實中，杯中的咖啡仍尚留一點餘溫。仍未完全從回憶中抽離的我，拿起咖啡淺嚐了一口，耶珈雪啡苦中帶酸的味道在口中蔓延，此時此刻發現，這杯咖啡的味道，其實跟生活挺像的🧩。苦中帶酸，略帶甜味，稱不上滑潤順口。但也因為這些層次，讓咖啡，更有味道，更有一再回味的價值☺️。如果現在的你，正在思考職涯的下一步，不妨給自己一些喘息的空間，讓自己有時間去更清楚地了解，真正想做的事情是什麼✨。新一輪的 hashtag#Hiring 也在持續進行中，給大家分享更多好職缺，一起為了心中理想的職涯和生活而努力吧🌞!🔎本次招募職缺: 💡Slot連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/g984YJRi💡背板連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具8年或以上連接器相關產品設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/gCaxDXF9💡車用連接器研發工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g8FPECwd💡Cable資深研發工程師/研發主管 (派駐廣州 / 大學以上學歷 / 具高頻高速線纜產品5年以上設計開發經驗 / 具研發專案團隊領導經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/gwJ5e8zW💡金屬材料研發人員 (派駐廣州 / 材料or化學相關博士學歷 / 無經驗可 / 具獨立進行學術研究能力者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g_rzemzQ💡高分子研發工程師 (派駐廣州 / 碩士以上學歷 / 無經驗可)🔗https://lnkd.in/gZJKVGGh💡高分子/材料工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 1年以上相關工作經歷)🔗https://lnkd.in/gmnT87q8若對以上外派RD職缺有興趣，歡迎透過以下方式與我聯繫或直接站內信給我，謝謝😌! 💼Contact infos:📲0983528361;📤simonho0325@lotestech.com。

Lakshmi Prasanna KatabattiniLakshmi Prasanna Katabattini,,"🚨 Important Warning for Students & Job Seekers 🚨Over the past few days, I’ve noticed a surge of fake internship posts circulating on LinkedIn.Companies like BlueStock, Bh****intern, Ocnet, CeSoft, Unifi Mentors, Iernpe, and Codlpha** are scamming students under the guise of offering internships. Here’s how they operate:🔹 They offer instant offer letters with no interview process 🔹 Force you to post about it on LinkedIn for promotion 🔹 Assign basic tasks like a JavaScript calculator, To-Do list, or Python mini-projects (QR code generator, auto-reply systems, etc.) 🔹 Then demand a fee for a “completion certificate”💔 What you really get: ❌ No real learning ❌ No mentorship ❌ Just a certificate in exchange for free promotion and moneyA true internship is meant to help you grow, learn, and gain practical experience—not just pad your resume with fake credibility.👉 Please research companies, check reviews, and NEVER pay for a certificate. Don’t fall for the trap.Let’s help each other stay informed and protect genuine learners from these scams.

Faaiza SharieffFaaiza Sharieff,,"🌪️ Resigning Without an Offer – A Brave Move or a Risky Gamble? 🌪️A friend of mine recently did something that sparked a lot of conversations.She resigned from her job without having another offer in hand.No backup. No bridge. Just a bold leap.At first, it felt empowering.She finally walked away from a toxic environment that was draining her energy and confidence. She said, “Peace of mind was more important than a payslip.”And honestly, that takes guts. 🙌But over the next few weeks, reality hit.Here’s what she experienced:✅ The Pros:Mental clarity and emotional space to focus on her job searchNo longer waking up with anxiety every morningTime to reflect and figure out what she actually wants from her next roleOpportunities started to come in once she aligned herself with purpose.❌ The Cons:A few weeks in, the lack of income became stressfulThe job search started feeling heavy without a safety netSome companies questioned the “employment gap”Self-doubt kicked in on tougher days: “Did I make a mistake?”So… was it good or bad?It depends on your situation, mindset, and financial cushion.She doesn’t regret her decision, but she does wish she had planned a little better.If you’re considering doing the same, ask yourself:🔹 Can I financially sustain myself for 2–3 months (or more)?🔹 Am I leaving with clarity, or just escaping the current situation?🔹 Do I have a job search strategy in place, or will I figure it out later?Leaving without an offer isn’t always a red flag. Sometimes, it’s a redirection.But it’s not a decision to take lightly.Would love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever resigned without another offer? What did it teach you?👇 Let’s have a real conversation in the comments.hashtag#CareerDecisions hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#LifeAfterResignation hashtag#WorkTransitions hashtag#RealTalk hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#HRTalks hashtag#ChoosingYourself hashtag#MindfulMoves

Derek ReppDerek Repp,,"""Accountants: a precious and increasingly pricy commodity."" 😊  The global shortage of accountants has been making headlines for years, but I reckon Deel's 2024 Global Hiring Report makes particularly interesting reading. It gives some pretty crazy stats about the growth in hiring and salaries for accountants and then draws comparison to software engineers. 🚀📈Specifically, hiring for accountants leapt 𝟳𝟰% last year, with salaries up 𝟭𝟱%—significantly ahead of software engineers (hiring up 𝟮𝟮%, salaries up 𝟴%).Also of note, Australia ranks #2 for hiring accountants, after only the US. All credit to Deel for items quoted. Check out the full report: https://lnkd.in/gZ4MPAVHWhat do you think, will AI do much to stem the growth in demand for accountants? To be honest, I’m a little surprised we’re not seeing it as much yet. 🤔hashtag#TheNewSoftwareEngineers hashtag#Accounting hashtag#GoAccountants hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#AccountantShortage

Simon HoSimon Ho,simonho0325@lotestech.com,"hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#LOTES hashtag#Alwaysconnecting 【Motivation? Why HR?】雨季來臨，潮濕泥濘的天氣，讓人們不得不放慢腳步，緩步前行👣。而陰雨連綿的天氣對我來說，是一個適合與自己獨處，回想過去、暢想未來的時間💭。週末時，去了一直想去但總沒時間前往的咖啡廳，點了一杯咖啡☕，看著杯中熱氣緩緩升起，我的記憶，回到了 hashtag#2021年 的夏天..hashtag#2021年 的夏天，仍在就讀大學的我，決定報考 hashtag#HR 相關的研究所! 作出這個決定時，同學及朋友都對我的決定表示不解:❓友人A: Simon, 你可以跟我說你為甚麼想讀人資所嗎?💡我的回答: 會對於 hashtag#HR 領域感到好奇是個偶然的機遇。大三的人力資源管理課程中，需製作一份完整的HRM報告。該份報告須從無到有創立一間新創公司並包含以下內容(e.g., 公司產業與背景、組織架構、未來發展方向等等)🏬。我主要負責區塊為HR選訓育用留等function的制度建置及後續優化，對於從未觸碰過HR領域的我，只能透過多方請教專業人才及個人累積的學術知識，成功完成該份報告🫡。這樣的經歷，也讓我對 hashtag#HR 領域產生高度興趣並願意在這條上長期發展，也同時是我想成為 hashtag#HR 專業人才，最初的motivation🙆‍♂️。hashtag#2022年 ，如願考上人資所的我，仍舊能聽到一些質疑聲，不外乎是針對該領域人員不需要讀研究所這點提出質疑:❓友人B: Simon, 你覺得你讀這個碩士值得嗎，有沒有其他更好的發展方向?🔥我的回答-嗯..沒有所謂值不值得吧，每個人的想法不同，價值觀也不同。就讀人資所主要有兩個原因:1️⃣宏觀-公司面: 希望自己能夠具備 hashtag#HR 領域充足的學術知識及素養，在公司遇到HR領域相關的問題時，可以適時提出想法建議，讓企業能夠往更好的未來持續邁進。2️⃣微觀-個人面: hashtag#HR 學術領域範圍既廣且深，想在這博大精深的地方，找出適合且喜歡的研究領域，持續鑽研，並能夠透過自身專業協助優秀人才找到適合自己的工作。hashtag#2024年 研究所畢業之後，對於不了解 hashtag#HR 的人來說，我們的工作可能是易如反掌且沒有技術含量的。也總會在日常生活中不經意聽到一些刺耳話語:❓友人C: Simon, hashtag#HR 不就是幫忙找人嗎再丟履歷給主管嗎，你何必讓自己做得這麼累?🔥我的回答: 其實不單單只是找履歷丟履歷而已，而是一種橋樑的角色。真正能夠讓我堅持下去的，是""find the guy that we need""的成就感🪴。hashtag#HR 工作是一個可以不斷接觸到不同領域、不同專業人才的絕佳管道，也能持續更新產業相關知識並了解企業人才需求，對於喜歡不斷學習新知識的我來說，這正是我想要，也剛好是我擅長的領域😁。也正是因為這些，我才會堅持，繼續走這條路。也希望自己能走到，退休的那一天😇。✍動機總結與個人體悟:""喜歡與人互動，幫助人選找到適合的位置""這句話，是數年前回覆給不理解我選擇 hashtag#HR 作為職涯的人們所說的一句話。幾年後重新回顧，這句話依然重要，但也發現對於目前的我來說，這只是想成為#HR 動機中的一小部分罷了🤣。絕大部分的原因是疊加在上述那句話上的，透過必要性的與人互動接觸，了解同業乃至其他主流產業對於人才與所需技能的需求，以此持續拓展對產業的理解與判斷未來趨勢的能力✍。從安排一場面試、人才媒合，到從 hashtag#HR 的角度出發參與企業未來策略布局，若能精準快速地掌握不同領域的發展脈動，就能見微知著，從人才需求中看見企業策略，從市場變化中洞察產業未來🔍。這段 hashtag#HR 旅程，走得並不算順利，但每個工作上遇到的挑戰，都成為我的養分，也讓我更加篤定，選擇 hashtag#HR 做為長期發展的職涯領域是正確的。也許多年後的我，會感謝現在的自己對於工作及理想的追求吧💪。hashtag#2025年 的四月，從記憶中回到了現實中，杯中的咖啡仍尚留一點餘溫。仍未完全從回憶中抽離的我，拿起咖啡淺嚐了一口，耶珈雪啡苦中帶酸的味道在口中蔓延，此時此刻發現，這杯咖啡的味道，其實跟生活挺像的🧩。苦中帶酸，略帶甜味，稱不上滑潤順口。但也因為這些層次，讓咖啡，更有味道，更有一再回味的價值☺️。如果現在的你，正在思考職涯的下一步，不妨給自己一些喘息的空間，讓自己有時間去更清楚地了解，真正想做的事情是什麼✨。新一輪的 hashtag#Hiring 也在持續進行中，給大家分享更多好職缺，一起為了心中理想的職涯和生活而努力吧🌞!🔎本次招募職缺: 💡Slot連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/g984YJRi💡背板連接器研發資深工程師 (派駐廣州 / 大專以上學歷 / 具8年或以上連接器相關產品設計開發經驗)🔗https://lnkd.in/gCaxDXF9💡車用連接器研發工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 具連接器相關產品3年以上設計開發經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g8FPECwd💡Cable資深研發工程師/研發主管 (派駐廣州 / 大學以上學歷 / 具高頻高速線纜產品5年以上設計開發經驗 / 具研發專案團隊領導經驗者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/gwJ5e8zW💡金屬材料研發人員 (派駐廣州 / 材料or化學相關博士學歷 / 無經驗可 / 具獨立進行學術研究能力者佳)🔗https://lnkd.in/g_rzemzQ💡高分子研發工程師 (派駐廣州 / 碩士以上學歷 / 無經驗可)🔗https://lnkd.in/gZJKVGGh💡高分子/材料工程師 (派駐廣東中山 / 大學以上學歷 / 1年以上相關工作經歷)🔗https://lnkd.in/gmnT87q8若對以上外派RD職缺有興趣，歡迎透過以下方式與我聯繫或直接站內信給我，謝謝😌! 💼Contact infos:📲0983528361;📤simonho0325@lotestech.com。

Here’s how they operate:🔹 They offer instant offer letters with no interview process 🔹 Force you to post about it on LinkedIn for promotion 🔹 Assign basic tasks like a JavaScript calculator, To-Do list, or Python mini-projects (QR code generator, auto-reply systems, etc.) 🔹 Then demand a fee for a “completion certificate”💔 What you really get: ❌ No real learning ❌ No mentorship ❌ Just a certificate in exchange for free promotion and moneyA true internship is meant to help you grow, learn, and gain practical experience—not just pad your resume with fake credibility.👉 Please research companies, check reviews, and NEVER pay for a certificate. Don’t fall for the trap.Let’s help each other stay informed and protect genuine learners from these scams.
