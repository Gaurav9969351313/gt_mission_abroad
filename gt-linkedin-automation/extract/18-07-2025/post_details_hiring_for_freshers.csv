DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

SUBASH SANKARSUBASH SANKAR,,"From Confused to Confident – My Manual Testing JourneyHi Connections,I’m happy to share a turning point in my career journey — moving from complete uncertainty about software testing to becoming a confident, job-ready QA professional. This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

SUBASH SANKARSUBASH SANKAR,,"From Confused to Confident – My Manual Testing JourneyHi Connections,I’m happy to share a turning point in my career journey — moving from complete uncertainty about software testing to becoming a confident, job-ready QA professional. This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

Reprogrammed)🔧 Testbench Generation? → Now done by LLMs.📊 Log & Waveform Debugging? → ML-based root-cause analysis (Cadence Verisium, Siemens Questa AI).📐 PPA Optimization? → RL agents like Synopsys Inc DSO.ai.🔁 RTL Rewrites? → LLM-based auto-correction and synthesis.🧪 Regression Analysis? → Data-driven AI pipelines.Even job postings ask for experience in AI now.> 💼 Companies like Synopsys Inc , Cadence , Intel Corporation , AMD , Samsung Semiconductor , Apple , and Qualcomm are building AI-native chips with fewer engineers than ever before.---📉 “I Just Need to Know Verilog” Is Over.🚫 Traditional flow is outdated.✅ Smart tools are auto-suggesting logic, auto-routing nets, and generating constraints.And if you’re not the one controlling the AI…You’re just pressing buttons while it takes your job.---⚔️ The AI-VLSI Battle Has BegunThe war isn’t VLSI vs AI.It’s VLSI + AI engineers vs those stuck in the past.💡 Want proof?Siemens Questa now auto-generates testbenches using fine-tuned LLMs trained on real RTL libraries.Synopsys Inc DSO.ai autonomously places and routes chips with better PPA than traditional flows. Synopsys Inc acquired Ansys will also play a important role in coming days to shift the gear to VLSI+ AI engineering!Cadence Verisium predicts bugs before you even open your waveform viewer.The message is clear:✨ “AI can now do your job. You must now master it.”---👨‍🏫 Learn AI for VLSI—Before You're Replaced🚀 We're launching a hands-on project-based course that teaches you:✅ How to use LLMs to generate testbenches✅ How to link Neural Networks with RTL✅ How to build AI-powered Protocol Debuggers✅ How to optimize chips using ML & Python and many more.......🎯 No AI background?

SUBASH SANKARSUBASH SANKAR,,"From Confused to Confident – My Manual Testing JourneyHi Connections,I’m happy to share a turning point in my career journey — moving from complete uncertainty about software testing to becoming a confident, job-ready QA professional. This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

Tanmay GoelTanmay Goel,,"In Amazon, if you can’t solve 2 DSA problems in 45 minutes — you’re out.In Google, if you can’t break down an unknown question — you’re out.In Microsoft, if you can’t explain and optimize on the spot — you’re out.But if you learn and use DSA patterns to solve two coding problems in 45 minutes, they’ll send you an acceptance email and move you to interview rounds..Try anywhere, from FAANG to WITCH company hiring processes,  DSA patterns are the real cheat code for coding interviews.And yet, even after knowing this, so many people aren’t using them correctly.That’s why they:— struggle to solve problems within the time limit— can’t build logic quickly enough under pressure— freeze when they get a new problem they haven’t seen beforeBelieve me, DSA patterns can help you in ways you don’t even realize:— They speed up your problem-solving, because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel— They make you spot solutions faster, even for brand new questions— They build real confidence (not just from grinding hundreds of random Leetcode problems)— They save you from getting stuck and losing hope midway through the testYes, DSA alone won’t guarantee the offer.But it can get you the opportunity.And sometimes, that’s all you need to change your life.P.S: To help you avoid the same mistake I made,I’ve found an amazing DSA Pattern Sheet that’ll change how you prep:✅ Identify key patterns and when to use them✅ Spot clues that map to approaches (Sliding Window? DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

SUBASH SANKARSUBASH SANKAR,,"From Confused to Confident – My Manual Testing JourneyHi Connections,I’m happy to share a turning point in my career journey — moving from complete uncertainty about software testing to becoming a confident, job-ready QA professional. This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

Tanmay GoelTanmay Goel,,"In Amazon, if you can’t solve 2 DSA problems in 45 minutes — you’re out.In Google, if you can’t break down an unknown question — you’re out.In Microsoft, if you can’t explain and optimize on the spot — you’re out.But if you learn and use DSA patterns to solve two coding problems in 45 minutes, they’ll send you an acceptance email and move you to interview rounds..Try anywhere, from FAANG to WITCH company hiring processes,  DSA patterns are the real cheat code for coding interviews.And yet, even after knowing this, so many people aren’t using them correctly.That’s why they:— struggle to solve problems within the time limit— can’t build logic quickly enough under pressure— freeze when they get a new problem they haven’t seen beforeBelieve me, DSA patterns can help you in ways you don’t even realize:— They speed up your problem-solving, because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel— They make you spot solutions faster, even for brand new questions— They build real confidence (not just from grinding hundreds of random Leetcode problems)— They save you from getting stuck and losing hope midway through the testYes, DSA alone won’t guarantee the offer.But it can get you the opportunity.And sometimes, that’s all you need to change your life.P.S: To help you avoid the same mistake I made,I’ve found an amazing DSA Pattern Sheet that’ll change how you prep:✅ Identify key patterns and when to use them✅ Spot clues that map to approaches (Sliding Window? DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

DP? Backtracking?)✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions✅ Track progress and customize your prep📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/4lYd9a9Prep smart & Solve faster :)hashtag#placement hashtag#job hashtag#freshers hashtag#dsa

This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer

SUBASH SANKARSUBASH SANKAR,,"From Confused to Confident – My Manual Testing JourneyHi Connections,I’m happy to share a turning point in my career journey — moving from complete uncertainty about software testing to becoming a confident, job-ready QA professional. This growth happened through focused learning and the right guidance from QSpiders.When I joined QSpiders, I didn’t know how software testing worked in the real world. But with time, effort, and expert mentoring, I now have strong clarity on the subject and practical testing skills.Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced over the past few months:Manual Testing – Writing real test cases, identifying bugs, and understanding SDLC and STLC end-to-endSQL – Writing queries to fetch and validate backend data using conditions and joinsAgile Methodology – Understanding sprint planning, team roles, and daily stand-upsSelenium – Basics of automation and writing simple test scriptsAPI Testing – Working with Postman to validate request and response workflowsPython – Beginner-level scripting for test automation logicWhat started as just interest has now become real confidence. I’ve developed not only technical skills but also better communication, logical thinking, and team collaboration — all essential for a QA role.I’m now actively looking for an opportunity as a Manual Tester / QA Fresher.I’m available to join immediately and open to relocation.If you or someone in your network is hiring, I would sincerely appreciate your support or any referral that can help me take the next step in my journey.Thank you for reading!hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#QSpiders hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#ChennaiJobs hashtag#TestingCareer hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SQL hashtag#APITesting hashtag#QAEngineer
