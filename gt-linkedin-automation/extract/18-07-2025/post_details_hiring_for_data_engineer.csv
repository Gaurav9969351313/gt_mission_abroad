His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

Bala SivalingamBala Sivalingam,,"Really enjoyed Peter Deng's insights on Lenny's Podcast. His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

Bala SivalingamBala Sivalingam,,"Really enjoyed Peter Deng's insights on Lenny's Podcast. His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

Bala SivalingamBala Sivalingam,,"Really enjoyed Peter Deng's insights on Lenny's Podcast. His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

Bala SivalingamBala Sivalingam,,"Really enjoyed Peter Deng's insights on Lenny's Podcast. His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

Bala SivalingamBala Sivalingam,,"Really enjoyed Peter Deng's insights on Lenny's Podcast. His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast

His classification of the 5 archetypes of Product Managers, thoughts on hiring, and frameworks for building high-performing teams truly resonated with me.Peter’s 5 archetypes of Product Managers:·      Consumer PM: Product leader who is half designer, deeply focused on creating delightful user experiences. ·      Growth PM: Product leader who drives data-based decisions, thinks like a data scientist and is driven by metrics and experimentation.·      Buiness PM: Half business leader, half product leader, wired to think about business model, margin, value creation ... thinks like a GM. ·      Platform PM: Deeply wired to build tools for others, adept at building systems for others to scale their work. ·      Algorithms/Research PM: Equal parts researcher, engineer and PM ... leverages technical depth to build innovative products.A few points that resonated:·      The importance of hiring PMs with different superpowers to create teams that outperform individually brilliant contributors. ·      Tangible frameworks to align and raise the bar for team performance. For example, creating healthy tension with different charges for team members coupled with a framework to adjudicate.·      Practical advice for identifying and supporting each PM type for the needs of your organization.Highly recommend this episode for anyone passionate about building great product teams!https://lnkd.in/e5q5C5kihashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LennysPodcast
