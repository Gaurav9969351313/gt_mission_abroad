shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team?

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team?

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them.

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals.

With over 3.5 years of experience in building, deploying, and optimizing data engineering solutions within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your data-driven initiatives.At HCLTech, I’ve had the opportunity to work on large-scale projects for Nestlé, where I designed and maintained scalable data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks (PySpark), and Synapse Analytics. I have been responsible for ingesting data from on-premise sources such as SQL Server, Oracle, and mainframe systems, leveraging Sqoop and metadata-driven designs via Excel. I’ve also optimized semantic models for reporting frameworks like Rahona, ensuring performance and maintainability.Beyond technical delivery, I bring strong DevOps awareness—utilizing Git, Jenkins, and Terraform for CI/CD and infrastructure as code. My background also includes support and automation using Logic Apps, PowerShell, and Perl scripting, along with orchestration using Oozie and Autosys. These skills enable me to bridge the gap between development and operations effectively.What excites me about this opportunity is the alignment between the role's requirements and my passion for solving real-world data problems through scalable and automated Azure-native solutions.I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can bring value to your team.

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals.

With over 3.5 years of experience in building, deploying, and optimizing data engineering solutions within the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your data-driven initiatives.At HCLTech, I’ve had the opportunity to work on large-scale projects for Nestlé, where I designed and maintained scalable data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks (PySpark), and Synapse Analytics. I have been responsible for ingesting data from on-premise sources such as SQL Server, Oracle, and mainframe systems, leveraging Sqoop and metadata-driven designs via Excel. I’ve also optimized semantic models for reporting frameworks like Rahona, ensuring performance and maintainability.Beyond technical delivery, I bring strong DevOps awareness—utilizing Git, Jenkins, and Terraform for CI/CD and infrastructure as code. My background also includes support and automation using Logic Apps, PowerShell, and Perl scripting, along with orchestration using Oozie and Autosys. These skills enable me to bridge the gap between development and operations effectively.What excites me about this opportunity is the alignment between the role's requirements and my passion for solving real-world data problems through scalable and automated Azure-native solutions.I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can bring value to your team.

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time.

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time.

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs

shen lishen li,,"💡 Why Cloud Infrastructure Feels Broken — And How Open Source Is the Quiet FixThe more I work in tech, the more I see an uncomfortable triangle emerge between:🔹 Employers — want cheap, scalable infra with affordable engineers🔹 Employees — want stable, transferable skills and fair pay🔹 Infra Providers (like AWS) — want to sell complex services and lock-inBut here’s the catch:The more power infra providers gain, the more expensive it becomes for both employers and employees to operate.Cloud platforms like AWS are incredibly capable, but they’re imperative-first and sprawling. That creates a hidden cost: you need highly skilled, certified engineers just to keep the system stable. Those engineers are hard to find, expensive to hire, and hard to retain.❗ Then we try to solve that with “Platform Engineering”…And often just make it worse.Building an internal platform feels like control — but it actually creates:More code to maintainMore hiring difficulty (platform engineers are even rarer)More internal knowledge silosA new kind of lock-in — your ownIf you’re not a FAANG-scale company, it’s often not worth it. You’re just replacing AWS complexity with your complexity.🌱 So what’s the way forward?Open source.When the system feels rigged, open tooling becomes the counterweight:Tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Crossplane, ArgoCD — create shared infrastructure languagesCommunity-maintained platforms reduce individual org burdenEngineers can build skills that transfer between companiesEmployers can hire based on open tooling, not internal abstractionsOpen source is how we rebalance the triangle.It’s not perfect — but it’s transparent, auditable, community-driven, and portable. That’s more than can be said for many internal platforms or cloud certifications.✅ The New RuleDon’t build what the open source community already maintains better than you ever will.Focus on stitching together proven tools. Reduce proprietary glue. Let infra scale with community wisdom — not isolated complexity.💬 Curious to hear from others: Have you faced this same triangle in your company or team? Did you go all-in on internal platforms — or lean into open source?hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#DevOps hashtag#OpenSource hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#AWS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechStrategy

Abhijeet ShindeAbhijeet Shinde,,"🔐 Common IAM Mistakes to Avoid in AWS 🔐1) Overprivileged Access: Granting excessive permissions increases security risk. Always start with least privilege and only grant what's necessary.2) Shared Credentials: Avoid sharing access keys or passwords. Every user should have unique credentials for accountability and traceability.3) Hardcoded Secrets: Never hardcode AWS keys in code or config files. Use IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager.4) Policy Conflicts:  When multiple policies are attached, understand how AWS evaluates them. A single Deny can override multiple Allows causing confusion or security gaps.5) Missing MFA: Not enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, especially for root and privileged users, is a major vulnerability.hashtag#AWS hashtag#IAM hashtag#SecurityBestPractices hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudSecurity ZS NTT DATA, Inc. hashtag#Amazon hashtag#cloud BNY hashtag#DevOps hashtag#TechTrends hashtag#LinkedInArticle hashtag#Remote hashtag#hiring hashtag#cloud

Keith VaughanKeith Vaughan,,"Things are moving at great pace.Cloud: As cloud engineers, we’re seeing our focus shift. From complex Kubernetes deployments and serverless functions. To the ever-evolving world of AI. We're revisiting and sharpening our foundational knowledge, filling in only the few gaps. So we can deploy AI models and pipelines with security and tight control.One of the most powerful tools we’ve seen so far is the open-source AWS Strands Agents SDK. It provides a model-driven framework for rapidly building intelligent agents and proof of concepts using Python. With support for local models as well as Amazon Bedrock. It also can connect to the wider model universe via LiteLLM. Many orchestration complexities are abstracted away, and it’s already used in production by AWS internally. Business: Within my own company, as Cipher Projects expands and becomes part of the broader software development organization Zimaw LLC, we’re now operating with a global footprint. Our client roster spans Europe and Australia.Managing projects across regions is taking up more of my time. We’ve got a diverse stream of work underway, hiring developers across DevOps, mobile, backend, and even Unreal Engine.My new interview series is gaining momentum, with 3 guests already lined up. I’m also working on a new book about how to scale your developer team. Without the security risks, hiring delays, and high costs of traditional staff augmentation or the talent bottlenecks of hiring solely within Australia.Happy Thursday!

Joe TavarezJoe Tavarez,,"🚀 This week was all about diving deep into my open-source project, Git-Captain. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ev35Skbm🚀 Navigating the choppy waters of legacy code, I hoisted the sails on my Node.js project, Git-Captain, taking command and steering it through a full-scale modernization. 🚀Over the past week, I transformed my legacy codebase I wrote a while back, into a secure, scalable, and future-ready app that aligns with..one sec...let me say this in my professional Software Engineer tone...""built to meet today’s Node.js architecture industry standards""🚀Oh, I documented everything! Thoroughly, obsessively, gloriously. 🤓And to that certain someone from my old engineering team (yes, YOU!) whose love for architecture diagrams bordered on poetic... this one’s for you. Your influence made me better, and honestly? You’d be proud. Heck, you might even frame a flowchart or two. 🧜‍♂️I’ve officially fallen in love with Mermaid diagrams and GitHub makes them look absolutely stunning.If you’ve made it this far (you legend), check out the sleek system architecture diagrams I built using Mermaid: https://lnkd.in/e7eDPKus and here: https://lnkd.in/ehpgrcxY Funny how Git-Captain sailed straight into Mermaid 🧜‍♂️ diagrams, talk about a poetic coincidence. But this upgrade was more than just pretty visuals. Here’s what got a serious overhaul:🔧 Modernization Efforts:• Upgraded from the deprecated request library to the modern Axios HTTP client• Implemented async/await patterns across the codebase• Ensured all dependencies are up-to-date with the latest secure versions• Attained a clean NPM audit report with no vulnerabilities🛡️ Strengthened Security Measures:• Integrated robust security middleware (Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting)• Enforced input validation using express-validator for all API endpoints• Developed a structured logging system with Winston• Established environment-specific security configurations📊 Comprehensive Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams:• Crafted over 11 interactive architecture diagrams using Mermaid• Detailed API flow documentation with Mermaid• Improved documentation and through visual system architecture diagrams, so anyone that wants to use the project or contribute can do so easilyKey Technologies Utilized: Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API, OAuth 2.0, Mermaid, Winston, Helmet.js, DockerThe application now efficiently manages GitHub repository operations with enterprise-level security, meticulous error handling, and deployment options ready for production.hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#GitHub hashtag#OAuth hashtag#Security hashtag#TechnicalWriting hashtag#SoftwareModernization hashtag#DevOps hashtag#APIs hashtag#Documentation---For recruiters and hiring managers: This project exemplifies (big word) my ability to:• Modernize legacy systems while preserving functionality• Implement top-tier enterprise security practices• Produce thorough technical documentation• Work with modern web technologies and APIs
