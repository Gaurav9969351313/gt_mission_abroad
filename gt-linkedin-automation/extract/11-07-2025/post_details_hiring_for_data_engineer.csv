Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱.

The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.

Desmond HoDesmond Ho,,"It took us 10 months to grow Rise from $0 to $40k ARR.In 2025, I spent 1000 hours studying how to run ads. With no agency help (all done alone), we bootstrapped from $40k to $1M ARR in 100 days.Here's what I learned:𝟭. 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽 (𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲) 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.All work you do in the highest level of abstraction (e.g. idea) to the lowest level (e.g. video editing), has a learning curve.𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.As you work, you climb up the learning curve. You soon hit a local maxima which limits your output due to lack of knowledge. And there's a global maxima which is the absolute ceiling of the channel.𝟯. 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮. 𝗦𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.Local maxima can be approximated by experiments and existing data. But no one knows the global maxima since it's non-deterministic.This is therefore the most important role of founders:1) identify channel with highest global maxima,2) unlock local maxima,3) climb the curve as fast as possible.𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴.You think in ""This thing is too hard"". But if you think in learning curve, you’re not very far away from that cracked engineer friend you know.𝟱. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗮.You climb the curve by working.The unit to produce work is either time or money (to buy other people’s time).By multi-tasking you spread your finite resources (time) across different channels, which slow down compounding. The only acceptable case to multitask is when you hit global maxima, or you’re identifying local maxima to all-in in one channel.𝟲. 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.You can borrow people’s progress (their distance climbed) by hiring them.𝟳. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯 𝗮 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.Learning curve is universal but how fast we climb a curve is different. It’s a mix of practice and gift.𝟴. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱.Companies in different countries are climbing the same curve, but countries usually have their own specialised learning curve where they’re leading other markets for at least 3 years. See the US in semi conductor, China in live streaming commerce.𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗳𝘂𝗹.Not all channel’s learning curve progress translate to commercial value, but climbing are equally difficult. So choose wisely which to climb.
