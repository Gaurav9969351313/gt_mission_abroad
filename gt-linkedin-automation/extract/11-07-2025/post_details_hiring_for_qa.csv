Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.

Rebecca BoydRebecca Boyd,,"📊 Hiring & Market Insight Update Market Intelligence (U.S., mid‑2025):✔️ Insurance firms face a projected talent gap of 400,000 roles by 2035—spurred by ongoing retirements and a struggle to attract millennials and Gen Z.✔️ Q1 2025 shows stability in premiums (+9.5% YoY in personal P&C), yet underwriting costs are rising with combined ratios near 91%. ✔️ Tariff volatility is squeezing U.S. manufacturers: tariff rate volatility has driven prices up 1–1.5%, with mid‑tier firms absorbing roughly $82B/year in added costs.✔️ In June, U.S. private job growth slowed to just 74K—eight-month low—due to uncertainty around rates, tariffs, and talent.🏢 Industry-Specific Vacancy Costs:🔹Insurance Industry: Average cost-per-day of vacancy for a mid-level insurer: $800–$1,200/day (lost sales, service disruption, increased workloads). Across 50 open roles, that’s ~$2M/month in deadweight.🔹Payroll & HR Services: A technical or client-facing vacancy averages $1,000+/day (service delays → client churn, compliance lag, extra OT). 20 unfilled jobs = $600K+ monthly early loss.🔹Manufacturing (steel, auto parts, electronics): With fluctuating tariffs, missing critical hires (e.g., QA engineers, ops leads) can cost $1,500–$2,500/day, magnified by supply-chain delays and downtime. The shifting tariff landscape (steel/aluminum at 52%, auto/copper at 25–50%) has made forecasting volatile for manufacturing. Our contract-to-hire hires let you adapt flexibly—outsourced payroll, benefits, and compliance, with no refund risk if tariffs shift. Results: cost savings of 58%+, hiring agility to ride the tariff waves.💡 Infinia's Competitive Edge:✔️ Insurance clients: Filled 30 producer and claims roles in 22 days, slashing vacancy cost by 55%, and improved time-to-fill from 90 to 19 days.✔️ Payroll & HR Services partners: Fully staffed a 15-seat technical onboarding team nationwide in <20 days, cutting overtime spend by 48%.✔️ Manufacturing partners: Filled 50+ engineers and operators using contract-to-hire—58% lower onboarding and benefit overhead; we handled WC, SUTA/FICA, payroll, comp claims across 50 states.✔️ Cut onboarding & HR burden up to 50%.✔️ Fill technical and commercial vacancies in weeks, not months.✔️ Mitigate productivity loss & client churn.✔️ Nationwide compliance in all 50 states.🔔 Don’t Let Vacancy Costs Rally!Each day your roles remain open means up to Total Revenue Loss: $25K–$330K in daily lost productivity, service delays, and margin bleed—time is money. DM me to align on a staffing strategy that cuts costs, speeds hiring, and delivers peace-of-mind compliance.📈 Next Steps:Book a Hiring Consultation on my profile link or Send me an InMail or email today—""WHY"" because each day that goes by is tens of thousands in vacancy cost slipping away.
