Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.
