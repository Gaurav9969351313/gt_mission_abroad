Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

I'd like to work on something next that has a similar positive impact on users, regardless of context. If you or anyone you know is hiring at the moment. Please reach out and let me know so that I can follow up and see if it's a good fit! Thanks for reading,Alex

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets?

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift.

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Please reach out and let me know so that I can follow up and see if it's a good fit! Thanks for reading,Alex

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

unuefa patienceunuefa patience,,"Searching for a remote job is so difficult. Lots of companies are looking for people some years of experience and what's not. The truth is how do we gain experience in a field when we are not given a chance at the job. Not everyone was privileged to work in certain companies and now that we want to build a career for ourselves, to grow and learn something different from what we know, it is so difficult. I am smart, a fast learner, a team player and I have an open mind for growth. Getting employed for a remote job will so gladden my heart.

I'd like to work on something next that has a similar positive impact on users, regardless of context. If you or anyone you know is hiring at the moment. Please reach out and let me know so that I can follow up and see if it's a good fit! Thanks for reading,Alex

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀

Hala E.Hala E.,,"🚨 Say No to Free Take-Home Assessments! 🚨In tech, we talk a lot about valuing engineers' time, yet unpaid take-home assessments remain a standard part of hiring. These tasks can take hours—sometimes even days—of research, coding, testing, and documentation.❌ For companies, it’s free labor.⏳ For candidates, it’s an investment with no guarantee of return.Many of us are already juggling full-time jobs, personal responsibilities, and (for some) even job hunting while unemployed. Expecting engineers to complete unpaid work as part of the hiring process undervalues their expertise.✅ Some companies do it right—offering compensation for take-home projects or alternatives like live technical discussions or pair programming. Others treat it as an unpaid trial, often leading nowhere.💰 My rate on Upwork is $30 per hour, and if a company expects me to spend hours on a take-home project, I expect to be compensated accordingly.After 8 years in this field, I am no longer willing to do free work. My skills, experience, and track record prove my expertise—no take-home test can showcase that better than my real-world results.📢 It’s time for a shift. If a company requires a significant take-home project, it should be paid.#🚀 hashtag#SayNoToFreeWork hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#FairPay hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#devops hashtag#sre hashtag#hiring hashtag#cv hashtag#coding hashtag#work hashtag#job hashtag#trend hashtag#fyp hashtag#top hashtag#reach hashtag#PayForWork hashtag#Engineering hashtag#NoFreeLabor

Rutuja K.Rutuja K.,,"🚀 Java Applets vs. Java Servlets – Explained with Real-Life Examples! ☕💻If you’ve ever wondered what Applets and Servlets are in Java, this post will clear everything up for you! Let's break it down with real-world examples so that even someone new to Java can understand.🖥️ What is a Java Applet?👉 Definition: A Java Applet is a small Java program that runs inside a web browser. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.👉 Real-Life Example: Think of a mini-game on a website (like an old Flash game). When you open the webpage, the game loads and runs inside the browser.📌 Key Points about Applets:✅ Runs in a web browser (requires a Java plugin).✅ Uses java.applet package.✅ Requires an HTML page to run.✅ Mostly deprecated now due to security issues and modern web technologies replacing it.🌐 What is a Java Servlet?👉 Definition: A Java Servlet is a server-side program that handles client requests (like form submissions) and generates dynamic web content.👉 Real-Life Example: Imagine you order food online 🍔📦. When you click “Order Now,” the request goes to the restaurant’s system (server), processes your request, and sends a confirmation. A Servlet works like that restaurant’s backend system—handling requests and sending responses!📌 Key Points about Servlets:✅ Runs on a server (not a browser).✅ Uses javax.servlet package.✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST).✅ Forms the backbone of Java-based web applications like online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.💡 Final Thought📌 Applets were great for interactive web content but are no longer used due to security risks and better alternatives (JavaScript, React, etc.).📌 Servlets, on the other hand, are still a core part of Java web development and power many websites today!Hope this helped! Have you ever worked with Servlets or Applets? Drop your thoughts in the comments!👇💬hashtag#Java hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Applets hashtag#Servlets hashtag#Backend hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment 🚀
