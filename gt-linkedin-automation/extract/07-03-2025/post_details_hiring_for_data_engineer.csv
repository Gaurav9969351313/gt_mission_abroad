Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers.

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations. Comment below - What are other red flags you’ve noticed or learned too late? Do you work somewhere that’s created a Healthy Work Environment and Leadership Structure?hashtag#AEC hashtag#Construction hashtag#California hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Culture hashtag#Leadership

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said.

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations. Comment below - What are other red flags you’ve noticed or learned too late? Do you work somewhere that’s created a Healthy Work Environment and Leadership Structure?hashtag#AEC hashtag#Construction hashtag#California hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Culture hashtag#Leadership

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership

Enrique Tejeda CanobbioEnrique Tejeda Canobbio,,"NOAA layoffs could ground some hurricane hunter flightshttps://ift.tt/NwzLCiEThe layoffs that hit about 800 NOAA employees last week will hamstring the agency's fleet of hurricane research aircraft, experts warn. Threat level: NOAA's aircraft have specialized equipment that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters lack. Their flights during hurricane season are aimed at feeding data into computer models to improve forecast accuracy.The now-thinly staffed team of flight directors, engineers, scientists and mechanics means NOAA will struggle to maintain a 24-hour-a-day tempo of flying its modified Gulfstream jet and aging WP-3 research aircraft, said Josh Ripp, who was laid off as a flight engineer since he was a probationary employee. Ripp said the missing flights will translate into less accurate forecasts and greater risk for coastal residents who are used to having at least two to three days' warning of a hurricane's predicted landfall location. He told Axios in an interview that the agency is now either short one person or is at just the level of personnel needed to staff 24/7 flight operations, which has been the desired tempo during past seasons. However, that assumes no one gets sick or has a family emergency and cannot crew a flight. NOAA, he said, is now ""playing the odds that everyone there is going to be fine all season."" Zoom in: Two others associated with NOAA's hurricane research program confirmed the challenges the agency faces after the layoffs hit its Office of Marine and Aviation Operations in Lakeland, Fla. According to Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off from working on hurricane forecast models at the National Hurricane Center, the cuts may compromise forecast accuracy and ultimately cost lives. He said NOAA uses the information from the flights in two ways. One is to gauge the intensity and movement of a storm, since such data is immediately relayed to the Hurricane Center. The other is to use the specialized equipment — such as powerful, tail-mounted-Doppler radar — to gather data that's fed into hurricane forecast models to better anticipate a storm's movement and shifts in intensity. Consistent NOAA and Air Force Reserve hurricane reconnaissance has helped lead to vast improvements in hurricane track forecasts in particular, with new gains made in intensity projections in recent years. Between the lines: NOAA only has a minimum capacity of flight directors, positions that require years of training, according to one source familiar with staffing issues who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution if they are rehired.It missed out on gaining three who were in the hiring process when the Trump administration instituted a government-wide freeze, and then lost two to the layoffs, the source said. ""This leaves the exact number for staffing four total WP-3 and G-IV crews,"" the source said. ""It leaves no room for anyone to get sick or have a life event that precludes them from being able to...

Africa ProCloud Institute Africa ProCloud Institute ,,"Why Companies Are Hiring a Lot of DevOps Engineers in 2025In 2025, the demand for DevOps engineers is soaring as organizations across industries recognize the pivotal role they play in modern technology environments. As the founder of Africa ProCloud Institute (APCI), I have witnessed firsthand the increasing need for skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between development and operations. Here’s why companies are aggressively hiring DevOps engineers this year.1. Unprecedented Cloud Adoption and ModernizationThe dominance of cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has created a massive need for DevOps engineers. As more companies migrate to the cloud, they require professionals who can manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have further amplified this demand, as seamless integration and operational efficiency become critical.2. Automation and Efficiency Are Non-NegotiableModern businesses thrive on efficiency, and DevOps engineers are masters of automation. Using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes, they transform manual, error-prone processes into automated workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, championed by DevOps professionals, have become industry standards to accelerate software delivery and minimize risks.3. The Rise of DevSecOps for Enhanced SecurityWith cybersecurity threats at an all-time high, integrating security into the development process has become a priority. DevSecOps is the answer, embedding security practices within DevOps workflows. DevOps engineers who possess the ability to automate security measures are in high demand, helping companies safeguard their digital assets while maintaining agility.4. AI and Machine Learning Integration Demands ExpertiseArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing industries, and DevOps engineers play a crucial role in deploying these technologies. By building and maintaining complex data pipelines and streamlining deployment strategies, they enable organizations to harness the power of AI and ML effectively.At APCI, We’re Preparing the Next Generation of DevOps EngineersAt Africa ProCloud Institute, our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to thrive as DevOps engineers. Our accelerated programs cover critical technologies and best practices, ensuring our graduates are ready to meet the demands of 2025 and beyond. If you’re looking to start or advance your career in cloud infrastructure and DevOps, visit https://lnkd.in/gt6VMrbg to learn more.By investing in your education and mastering DevOps, you position yourself at the forefront of a growing field with endless opportunities.

Mukesh KumarMukesh Kumar,,"GTM isn't just a fancy way of saying ‘marketing and sales.’And if you’ve ever tried to scale pipeline and revenue predictably, you know it’s a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.I’ve been in the trenches—figuring out what actually works in B2B demand gen, outbound, and RevOps.And here’s the thing: most companies don’t have a GTM problem. They have a GTM engineering problem.- They generate leads, sure. But those leads sit in a CRM graveyard.- They run outbound, but they’re chasing the wrong accounts.- They invest in content, but there’s no structured path to conversion.So I started mapping out a GTM funnel that actually makes sense—not just for marketing, not just for sales, but for the entire revenue motion.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Generating awareness, leads: I think we must stop dumping money into ads and outbound without understanding intent. The best GTM teams don’t just “spray and pray""—they engineer lead flow.But how?- for Inbound: Create high-intent content (not just blog spam). SEO, LinkedIn, partnerships, and strategic ads should all pull in ICPs.- for Outbound: Instead of cold emails to random lists, use hiring signals, funding rounds, and competitor churn data to find warm prospects.- PLG (Product-Led Growth): Optimize trial-to-paid motion, referral loops, and activation triggers.STOP running blind. Target those already in-market.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Lead qualification, nurturing: This is where most businesses lose deals.Hw to fix:- Better scoring and routing: not all leads should go to sales. Prioritize. Actively engage these-multiple touches, return visits, direct response, etc.- Nurturing → Think multi-threaded outreach. If a lead downloads your guide, they should see LinkedIn retargeting, get nurtured via email, AND be added to a priority outbound list.I mean, a “just browsing” lead should NOT get the same follow-up as someone who viewed pricing.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Closing, expansion: This is where most GTM teams win or lose REVENUE. How to make sure you win?- Sales pipeline optimization: AI-assisted proposals, automated deal-stage workflows, and buyer-intent tracking. Do these, and sure ur win rates get better.- Expansion and retention:  Cross-sells, upsells, and churn prevention should be engineered into the GTM motion (not an afterthought).Sales team manually following up without automation or data-driven triggers, are burning deals. Follow-up speed absolutely matters.And all this isn’t some theory—sound GTM systems “generate pipeline” and move deals to revenue.Love to hear how you approach GTM.Here’s a (bad :)) visual breakdown of the whole thing.

Zach WheelerZach Wheeler,,"5 RED FLAGS 🚩 to watch for in job interviews, office teams, on-site and overall in your career: 🚩 They tell you work is “home” and their coworkers are their “family.” 🚩They talk about emotional intelligence being able to “switch off” hurt feelings when a manager or coworker is toxic or abusive.  This includes both in the office and on-site.  Just because there are shovels and equipment and scaffolding in our industry and tight budgets and deadlines, does not mean culture goes out the window.  Nothing is so urgent that it can’t be communicated. 🚩Buzzwords, Phrases, and Analogies like Curious, Synergy, Data-Driven or “Message to Garcia.” 🚩 They are looking for entry level members who “lead up” instead of hiring leaders who are productive AND effectively meeting their goals. 🚩 Unwilling to negotiate pay OR maybe they’re unable to, due to corporate management structures and rigid expectations.

Thomas in't VeldThomas in't Veld,,"Your best data hire might be a marketer, not another engineer.Data teams are drowning in technical expertise while starving for business context. In nearly every org we talk to at Tasman Analytics, we see the same pattern: Brilliant data engineers ✅building flawless pipelines ✅that produce metrics nobody trusts. ❌The big missing ingredient? Subject matter expertise.When your data team doesn't understand what a ""qualified lead"" means to sales, or why customer lifetime value calculations matter to marketing, technical excellence becomes meaningless.In a recent webinar with Yali Sassoon, we talked about how:1️⃣ Data teams need business domain knowledge to build truly valuable data products2️⃣ Hiring someone with marketing, product, or finance backgrounds into your data team can transform its effectiveness3️⃣ Technical problems are often easier to solve than meaning problems4️⃣ The most successful teams actively seek context from stakeholders rather than working in isolation.This doesn't mean turning your data engineers into marketers. It means creating a team with diverse expertise that can translate business questions into technical solutions.One practical approach? Have your data team spend time embedded with the departments they support. Another? Consider hiring a performance marketer or product manager directly into your analytics function.What's your experience? Has subject matter expertise been a missing link in your data initiatives?hashtag#DataTeams hashtag#AnalyticsStrategy hashtag#BusinessIntelligence hashtag#DataLeadership
