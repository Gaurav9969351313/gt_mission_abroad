Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years. These engineers are powering everything from blockchain systems to web infrastructures. 👉 Salary Insights Rust developers command $120k–$180k/year. DevOps Engineers? $110k–$190k/year. For Smart Contract Engineers, expect to pay $150k+. Competitive offers are no longer optional—they’re a baseline. 👉 Common Hiring Mistakes Overcomplicating job requisitions: Candidates are skipping listings with unclear roles or endless requirements.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward.

Here’s What You Should Know!If you’re struggling to find top talent for these roles, you’re not alone. 👉 Hiring Trends Demand has skyrocketed, especially for Rust developers—up 120% in the past two years.

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Ali Imtisal NaqiAli Imtisal Naqi,,"Navigating Global Opportunities: A Lesson in TransparencyOver the past few months, I’ve actively pursued global roles, investing significant time and effort into the process—completing case studies, preparing presentations, and going through multiple rounds of interviews. In several instances, I successfully qualified for the final rounds, only to be met with an unexpected hurdle at the offer stage: the preference for a local candidate to avoid visa sponsorship and additional liabilities or some limited sponsorships quota or whatever.While I completely understand the operational and financial constraints companies face, such policies should be communicated at the beginning of the hiring process. Clear expectations help both candidates and hiring teams avoid unnecessary time investment and frustration. If visa sponsorship isn’t a possibility due to some xyz reasons, it’s only fair to be upfront about it from the start.To those navigating similar experiences—keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a stepping stone to the right opportunity!

IKHLAQ BUTTIKHLAQ BUTT,,"ATTENTION🚨I've been searching for a job as a fresher for over six months using various job sites like Internshala, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Unstop. Despite applying to many roles, I haven't received any responses from HRs, which has been frustrating and discouraging.Every day I wake up with the hope of landing an interview, only to be told I'm either overqualified or lack the necessary experience. Applying to numerous roles and dealing with imposter syndrome has been exhausting.Moreover, I've noticed that LinkedIn is now filled with misleading job postings. Fake recruiters often share links from other platforms like Unstop instead of direct application links. Some posts ask you to ""write your name and email in the comment section"" or ""drop your email in the comment box"" for exam links or shortlist notifications, but these often turn out to be scams.Even when freshers are hired, the compensation offered is usually very low, despite the high cost of their education. Are these job postings even real? Are freshers getting hired at all? Why do HRs ask candidates to use hashtags like hashtag#interested in job postings if they don't even check profiles?Every company provides training for new employees, so why not give freshers a chance? They have the potential to excel with proper training and hard work. Freshers need genuine opportunities, not more pressure.If you've had similar experiences or have any tips, please share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's support each other in navigating this challenging job market. Good luck to everyone. hashtag#ithashtag#internship hashtag#needjob
