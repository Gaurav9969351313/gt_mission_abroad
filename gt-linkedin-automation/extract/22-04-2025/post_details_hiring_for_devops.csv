Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent.

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent.

That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent.

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics

Fetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)ExpertFetiye Bektas The International Trade and Finance (CITF®)Expert,,"Rethinking the Value of Skilled Professionals in Foreign TradeIn many companies, hiring decisions often come down to one thing: budget.But from years of experience in foreign trade operations, I’ve learned that focusing solely on cost can be a short-sighted approach that costs far more in the long run.🧭 A skilled foreign trade professional does so much more than process paperwork.We manage risks, build strong supplier relationships, ensure smooth logistics, prevent costly delays, and protect your company from legal and compliance issues. That’s value you can’t measure by salary alone.💸 Hiring based on ""cheaper"" salaries may save you today, but here’s what it could cost you tomorrow:🚫 Missed shipments & lost customers 💰 Increased costs due to inefficiencies ⚠️ Damaged partner trust & reputation 📉 Financial losses that far exceed any salary savings👉 Invest in skill. Invest in stability.Foreign trade is more than just shipping goods — it’s about navigating currency risks, customs regulations, logistics, and supplier relations across borders. One mistake can lead to delays, fines, and lost business — far outweighing the initial savings on a lower salary.🔍 I believe in the value of skill, experience, and strategic investment.When organizations prioritize expertise, long-term growth, and a well-managed operation, the results speak for themselves. It’s not just about meeting short-term needs, but about creating a foundation for sustained success.We don’t just work. We coordinate. We prevent. We protect.hashtag#ForeignTrade hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SupplyChain hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#SmartHiring hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Logistics
