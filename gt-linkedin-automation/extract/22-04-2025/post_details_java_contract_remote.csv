Pedro MartinsPedro Martins,,"UI-TARS-1.5 Outperforms OpenAI Operator and Claude’s Computer Use Capability ByteDance has unveiled UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent that sets new benchmarks in GUI automation and virtual task execution.​Built upon a robust vision-language model, UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reinforcement learning to enable a ""think-then-act"" approach. This design allows the agent to reason through tasks before execution, enhancing performance and adaptability in complex environments.​Key achievements of UI-TARS-1.5 include:- Superior Benchmark Performance: Achieved 94.2% accuracy on ScreensSpot-V2 (GUI navigation benchmark) and 61.6% on ScreenSpotPro (complex UI task benchmark), outperforming previous state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Operator and Claude’s CLI-based agents in both low-level UI control and strategic planning.- Zero-shot Game Mastery: Achieved 100% success on 14 out-of-distribution GUI-based mini-games from Poki, demonstrating robust visual understanding and control policies.- Multi-step UI Task Solving: Efficient in long-horizon GUI tasks such as system settings configuration, tool navigation, and application control, without requiring fine-tuning on each app.UI-TARS-1.5 introduces a modular native agent architecture that fuses:- Perception (VLM)- Planning (Rationale Generator)- Memory- Action Execution (Click/Key APIs).This modularity allows the agent to generalize across unseen environment, paving the way for next-gen virtual assistants, automated QA, and enterprise RPA.ℹ️ If you want to explore more please check my comments. hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#AIAgents hashtag#Automation hashtag#RPA

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2. Our design decodes the TC[9,128] and reception of this particular message is allowed.3.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 48: Custom Exceptions in Java (Course Join and 12th Grade Requirement) 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of custom exceptions in Java, where you can create your own exception class to handle specific error conditions. ✅ How to throw and catch custom exceptions to handle business logic or validation rules (e.g., ensuring a student is in 12th grade before joining a course). ✅ Real-world example of creating a custom exception for enforcing requirements before a student can join a course.🔥 Why It Matters: Custom exceptions help you enforce specific business rules or validation conditions within your application, making your code more expressive and easier to maintain. Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Mehrad BazrgarMehrad Bazrgar,,"How to review a contract beyond the obvious?As a contract drafter, one key responsibility is reviewing contracts thoroughly. But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in Simple Math 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A,Dr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

You may say: hashtag#Both_Parties_have_agreed_on_so_and_so hashtag#as_stated_in_Clause_XThis shift in mindset opens the door to various opportunities, such as: Therefore, let us renegotiating that clause, or applying it in a more flexible manner, while still honoring both parties' responsibilities and obligations under the contract.hashtag#For_example:• Offering a Retention Bond to release cash instead of waiting for TOC to be issued then DLP to be expired • Requesting on-account payments for Variations pending formal and final evaluation• Issuing undertaking letters to maintain momentum untill fulfilling a Particular obligation as stated in the Contract• Back dated TOC aganist extended DLP• Give and Take dealsIt’s not about avoiding the Contract, it’s about using it hashtag#intelligently.The point is : Administering a Contract keeps you hashtag#Compliant while Managing it keeps you hashtag#Competitive.In today's complex construction landscape, only those who understand and act on this difference can truly protect their position and optimise project delivery.This is the difference between just hashtag#Running a Project, and hashtag#Steering it.hashtag#Tell_me : Which approach or style do you adopt in handling contractual situations?

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

The result is a dashboard that predicts, explains and actively combats member attrition.Tech paradigms move as fast as your LinkedIn feed 🎬 Every time you refresh, linkedin,  pops up—Databutton, Streamlit, low‑/no‑code LLM wrappers…the options are endless. I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

The result is a dashboard that predicts, explains and actively combats member attrition.Tech paradigms move as fast as your LinkedIn feed 🎬 Every time you refresh, linkedin,  pops up—Databutton, Streamlit, low‑/no‑code LLM wrappers…the options are endless. I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

Antoine MERMETAntoine MERMET,,"Last week at nanoTRONIC, I successfully run a VHDL simulation that handles TM/TC and time synchronization over SpaceWire for an European Space Agency - ESA Earth observation mission.Our FPGA design handles: - SpaceWire I/F based on STAR-Dundee IP - SpaceWire redundancy - SpaceWire packet - CCSDS packet - Packet Utilization Standard (PUS)Figure on the top shows the SpaceWire initialization and transfer of time code (here we used it to received a Pulse Per Second (PPS) from the spacecraft):1. Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2. Our design decodes the TC[9,128] and reception of this particular message is allowed.3.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

You may say: hashtag#Both_Parties_have_agreed_on_so_and_so hashtag#as_stated_in_Clause_XThis shift in mindset opens the door to various opportunities, such as: Therefore, let us renegotiating that clause, or applying it in a more flexible manner, while still honoring both parties' responsibilities and obligations under the contract.hashtag#For_example:• Offering a Retention Bond to release cash instead of waiting for TOC to be issued then DLP to be expired • Requesting on-account payments for Variations pending formal and final evaluation• Issuing undertaking letters to maintain momentum untill fulfilling a Particular obligation as stated in the Contract• Back dated TOC aganist extended DLP• Give and Take dealsIt’s not about avoiding the Contract, it’s about using it hashtag#intelligently.The point is : Administering a Contract keeps you hashtag#Compliant while Managing it keeps you hashtag#Competitive.In today's complex construction landscape, only those who understand and act on this difference can truly protect their position and optimise project delivery.This is the difference between just hashtag#Running a Project, and hashtag#Steering it.hashtag#Tell_me : Which approach or style do you adopt in handling contractual situations?

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do.

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in Simple Math 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A,Dr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Daniel GolDaniel Gol,,"I just shipped my very first end‑to‑end web app 🚀 As part of our second‑semester Data Analytics exam, I built a web‑based tool for a real stakeholder—Business Viborg—focused on the heart of the case - churn. The result is a dashboard that predicts, explains and actively combats member attrition.Tech paradigms move as fast as your LinkedIn feed 🎬 Every time you refresh, linkedin,  pops up—Databutton, Streamlit, low‑/no‑code LLM wrappers…the options are endless. I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately.

Antoine MERMETAntoine MERMET,,"Last week at nanoTRONIC, I successfully run a VHDL simulation that handles TM/TC and time synchronization over SpaceWire for an European Space Agency - ESA Earth observation mission.Our FPGA design handles: - SpaceWire I/F based on STAR-Dundee IP - SpaceWire redundancy - SpaceWire packet - CCSDS packet - Packet Utilization Standard (PUS)Figure on the top shows the SpaceWire initialization and transfer of time code (here we used it to received a Pulse Per Second (PPS) from the spacecraft):1. Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2. Our design decodes the TC[9,128] and reception of this particular message is allowed.3. Our design generates a successful acceptance verification report telemetry TM[1,1] to acknowledge the TC[9,128] reception.4.

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

The result is a dashboard that predicts, explains and actively combats member attrition.Tech paradigms move as fast as your LinkedIn feed 🎬 Every time you refresh, linkedin,  pops up—Databutton, Streamlit, low‑/no‑code LLM wrappers…the options are endless. I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

But let’s clarify something important: an expert doesn't just read and comment on what's in the draft — the real skill lies in identifying what’s missing. Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning. A thoughtful drafter should also:1.Break down the scope of work step by step2.Understand how the work will be performed3.Consider each party’s resources, personnel, and responsibilities4.Map out the financial flows and payment mechanisms5.Account for HSE (Health, Safety & Environment) obligations6.Anticipate technical or operational risks that could ariseEach of these areas can uncover contract terms that are missing but necessary to protect the parties and ensure smooth execution.Drafting isn’t just about writing — it’s about thinking ahead.hashtag#ContractManagement hashtag#RiskAssessment hashtag#ISO31000 hashtag#LegalDrafting hashtag#HSE hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ContractReview

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Daniel GolDaniel Gol,,"I just shipped my very first end‑to‑end web app 🚀 As part of our second‑semester Data Analytics exam, I built a web‑based tool for a real stakeholder—Business Viborg—focused on the heart of the case - churn. The result is a dashboard that predicts, explains and actively combats member attrition.Tech paradigms move as fast as your LinkedIn feed 🎬 Every time you refresh, linkedin,  pops up—Databutton, Streamlit, low‑/no‑code LLM wrappers…the options are endless. I evaluated several, but ultimately chose R Shiny. We’d just covered it in class, and I wanted to take on the challenge directly, even though Python often pairs more smoothly with AI. That hard‑but‑flexible route let me own every line of code, every SQL join and every pixel of the user interface.What the Business Viborg Churn & Strategy Dashboard can doSpot at‑risk members with machine‑learning risk scores.Explain churn drivers through interactive visualizations.Segment members intelligently using K‑Means clustering.Run “what‑if” simulations to see the impact of changes in loyalty, price or engagement.Map geographic patterns with Leaflet.Generate retention playbooks via an embedded AI copilot.Surface new leads (currently simulated) to support both growth and retention.Under the hoodR Shiny: fully open‑source and pushed to the limit for a responsive, modular interface.Cursor IDE: steep learning curve but immense creative freedom.Gradient‑boosted churn model: trained and tuned on historical member behaviour.Context‑aware AI copilot: wired in pure R/Shiny to receive live context (active filters, selected company, current tab) and invoke backend functions via an OpenAI o3‑style function‑calling layer. Bridging that gap was a major technical challenge, but now it’s ready for future multimodal upgrades.Why it matters for Business ViborgShift from reactive to proactive member retention.Allocate resources where they have the greatest impact.Maintain one shared, data‑driven view of the membership base across the organization.Leverage AI as a collaborative partner to test hypotheses and generate new ideas.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards. But that’s just the beginning.

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in Simple Math 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A,Dr Sagar Gulati

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business? Have you ever had a situation where a solid contract saved the day?hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Contracts hashtag#InteriorDesign

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business?

Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2.

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

But let’s be clear: they are not really in my opinion the same.hashtag#Contract_Administration_is_only #: 1 + 1 = 2While hashtag#Contract_Management_could_be #: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2Or even, #. 1 + 0.75 + 0.25 = 2In other words, both aim for compliance with the Contract, but Contract Management finds hashtag#Alternative, hashtag#Strategic paths to get there, without losing sight of the Contract’s Structure or the Parties’ Shared Objectives.hashtag#Contract_Administration is hashtag#linear:• Follow the Clauses, • Meeting the Requirements • Issuing Notices,• Submitting Interim Payment Applications, • Following Up on Instructions.hashtag#Contract_Management, on the other hand, involves:• Proposing new approaches to achieve the same result• Preserving the Employer’s and Contractor’s commercial intent • Finding practical resolutions when challenges arise• Keeping the contractual framework intact while adjusting the pathAs a Contract Administrator, your typical approach may be to state: hashtag#The_Contract_Stipulates_so_and_so.This approach often confines you to a rigid path, one that may not always serve the Contractor's or the Project's best interests.In contrast, as a Contract Manager, your perspective should be broader. You may say: hashtag#Both_Parties_have_agreed_on_so_and_so hashtag#as_stated_in_Clause_XThis shift in mindset opens the door to various opportunities, such as: Therefore, let us renegotiating that clause, or applying it in a more flexible manner, while still honoring both parties' responsibilities and obligations under the contract.hashtag#For_example:• Offering a Retention Bond to release cash instead of waiting for TOC to be issued then DLP to be expired • Requesting on-account payments for Variations pending formal and final evaluation• Issuing undertaking letters to maintain momentum untill fulfilling a Particular obligation as stated in the Contract• Back dated TOC aganist extended DLP• Give and Take dealsIt’s not about avoiding the Contract, it’s about using it hashtag#intelligently.The point is : Administering a Contract keeps you hashtag#Compliant while Managing it keeps you hashtag#Competitive.In today's complex construction landscape, only those who understand and act on this difference can truly protect their position and optimise project delivery.This is the difference between just hashtag#Running a Project, and hashtag#Steering it.hashtag#Tell_me : Which approach or style do you adopt in handling contractual situations?

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Vaishnavi BahetiVaishnavi Baheti,,"Handshake is great, but a contract is even better.For the longest time, I thought trust and a quick handshake were enough to get things moving. But over time, I’ve learned that a well-written contract is a game-changer. It’s the peace of mind you need, and it helps both sides avoid any confusion later on.It’s not just a piece of paper, it's a framework that clearly outlines the expectations, scope, and responsibilities for both you and your client. It sets the stage for transparency, accountability, and professionalism.Having a well drafted contract signed on a stamp paper not only protects you legally but also gives the client a sense of security. It also fosters trust, as the terms are clearly laid out, making the entire process smoother and more professional.A solid contract is as important as the work you do. It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s about setting the right foundation for a strong, honest relationship with your clients.What’s your experience with contracts in your business? Have you ever had a situation where a solid contract saved the day?hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#Contracts hashtag#InteriorDesign

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Some of the most critical risks are hidden in the omissions. Articles that should be in the contract, but aren’t.So how do you spot them?One effective method is conducting a risk assessment using frameworks like ISO 31000 or other industry standards.

It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...
