Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins.

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Shruti DwivediShruti Dwivedi,,"🌟 BBA vs B.Com: Which One is Right for Your Career? 🤔Choosing the right undergraduate course is one of the first major career decisions — and BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and B.Com (Bachelor of Commerce) often top the list.Here’s a quick breakdown to help you or your child make an informed choice:🔹 BBA – For Future Managers & Entrepreneurs ✅ Practical, industry-oriented approach ✅ Ideal for careers in marketing, HR, operations, or MBA prep ✅ Great for those who love leadership, presentations & projects🔹 B.Com – For Finance, Accounts & Core Commerce Roles ✅ Strong foundation in accounting, taxation, economics ✅ Ideal for careers in CA, CS, CFA, banking & analytics ✅ Great for those who love numbers, analysis & policy💡 Ask yourself: – Are you inclined toward leadership and management early on? → BBA – Do you want strong financial and accounting knowledge with career flexibility? → B.Com🎯 Pro tip: No course is ""better"" — it depends on your goals, learning style, and long-term vision.💬 What did you choose — or what would you recommend to today’s students?

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful.

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Shruti DwivediShruti Dwivedi,,"🌟 BBA vs B.Com: Which One is Right for Your Career? 🤔Choosing the right undergraduate course is one of the first major career decisions — and BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and B.Com (Bachelor of Commerce) often top the list.Here’s a quick breakdown to help you or your child make an informed choice:🔹 BBA – For Future Managers & Entrepreneurs ✅ Practical, industry-oriented approach ✅ Ideal for careers in marketing, HR, operations, or MBA prep ✅ Great for those who love leadership, presentations & projects🔹 B.Com – For Finance, Accounts & Core Commerce Roles ✅ Strong foundation in accounting, taxation, economics ✅ Ideal for careers in CA, CS, CFA, banking & analytics ✅ Great for those who love numbers, analysis & policy💡 Ask yourself: – Are you inclined toward leadership and management early on? → BBA – Do you want strong financial and accounting knowledge with career flexibility? → B.Com🎯 Pro tip: No course is ""better"" — it depends on your goals, learning style, and long-term vision.💬 What did you choose — or what would you recommend to today’s students?

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Shruti DwivediShruti Dwivedi,,"🌟 BBA vs B.Com: Which One is Right for Your Career? 🤔Choosing the right undergraduate course is one of the first major career decisions — and BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) and B.Com (Bachelor of Commerce) often top the list.Here’s a quick breakdown to help you or your child make an informed choice:🔹 BBA – For Future Managers & Entrepreneurs ✅ Practical, industry-oriented approach ✅ Ideal for careers in marketing, HR, operations, or MBA prep ✅ Great for those who love leadership, presentations & projects🔹 B.Com – For Finance, Accounts & Core Commerce Roles ✅ Strong foundation in accounting, taxation, economics ✅ Ideal for careers in CA, CS, CFA, banking & analytics ✅ Great for those who love numbers, analysis & policy💡 Ask yourself: – Are you inclined toward leadership and management early on? → BBA – Do you want strong financial and accounting knowledge with career flexibility? → B.Com🎯 Pro tip: No course is ""better"" — it depends on your goals, learning style, and long-term vision.💬 What did you choose — or what would you recommend to today’s students?

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

You carry one thing in your bag — a Swiss Army Knife.Why?Because it has everything — scissors, a knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, and more.That’s exactly what FCL is for a .NET developer.A one-stop toolbox that helps you build your app without reinventing the wheel every time.What is FCL (Framework Class Library)?It’s a collection of ready-made classes, interfaces, and value types that provide core functionalities like: •	Reading files •	Working with databases •	Displaying data on screen •	Encrypting information •	Sending messages & more😇Why should you care?Because without FCL, you’d be writing 100s of lines of code just to read a text file or make an API call.Real-Life Analogy:Need to fix your glasses?Grab the mini screwdriver from your Swiss knife — no need to carry a full toolbox.Need to parse a JSON in .NET?Use System.Text.Json from FCL — no need to write your own parser.So, next time you open Visual Studio, remember:FCL is your Swiss Army Knife — making your developer journey lighter, faster, and smarter!Have you discovered any hidden gem in FCL that made your day easier?Drop it in the comments!hashtag#DotNet hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#FCL hashtag#CodingSimplified hashtag#DevLife hashtag#CleanCode

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Vaibhavsing RajputVaibhavsing Rajput,,"“Why FCL is Like a Swiss Army Knife for Developers!”🤷Imagine this:You’re on a solo trip. You carry one thing in your bag — a Swiss Army Knife.Why?Because it has everything — scissors, a knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, and more.That’s exactly what FCL is for a .NET developer.A one-stop toolbox that helps you build your app without reinventing the wheel every time.What is FCL (Framework Class Library)?It’s a collection of ready-made classes, interfaces, and value types that provide core functionalities like: •	Reading files •	Working with databases •	Displaying data on screen •	Encrypting information •	Sending messages & more😇Why should you care?Because without FCL, you’d be writing 100s of lines of code just to read a text file or make an API call.Real-Life Analogy:Need to fix your glasses?Grab the mini screwdriver from your Swiss knife — no need to carry a full toolbox.Need to parse a JSON in .NET?Use System.Text.Json from FCL — no need to write your own parser.So, next time you open Visual Studio, remember:FCL is your Swiss Army Knife — making your developer journey lighter, faster, and smarter!Have you discovered any hidden gem in FCL that made your day easier?Drop it in the comments!hashtag#DotNet hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#FCL hashtag#CodingSimplified hashtag#DevLife hashtag#CleanCode

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure.

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

Vaibhavsing RajputVaibhavsing Rajput,,"“Why FCL is Like a Swiss Army Knife for Developers!”🤷Imagine this:You’re on a solo trip. You carry one thing in your bag — a Swiss Army Knife.Why?Because it has everything — scissors, a knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, and more.That’s exactly what FCL is for a .NET developer.A one-stop toolbox that helps you build your app without reinventing the wheel every time.What is FCL (Framework Class Library)?It’s a collection of ready-made classes, interfaces, and value types that provide core functionalities like: •	Reading files •	Working with databases •	Displaying data on screen •	Encrypting information •	Sending messages & more😇Why should you care?Because without FCL, you’d be writing 100s of lines of code just to read a text file or make an API call.Real-Life Analogy:Need to fix your glasses?Grab the mini screwdriver from your Swiss knife — no need to carry a full toolbox.Need to parse a JSON in .NET?Use System.Text.Json from FCL — no need to write your own parser.So, next time you open Visual Studio, remember:FCL is your Swiss Army Knife — making your developer journey lighter, faster, and smarter!Have you discovered any hidden gem in FCL that made your day easier?Drop it in the comments!hashtag#DotNet hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#FCL hashtag#CodingSimplified hashtag#DevLife hashtag#CleanCode

Here's how to turn “no experience” into your biggest asset: 👇🔹 Step 1: Learn the Language Spend just a week getting familiar with key terms like: CDD, EDD, PEP, UBO, Red Flags, Sanctions, SARs. 🎯 Tip: If you can explain these to a friend, you’re already ahead of 80% of applicants.🔹 Step 2: Take One Small Certification You don't need to spend $$$. Even a LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, or ACAMS free webinar course can help show you're serious.🔹 Step 3: Talk Like You’re Already In Update your LinkedIn: 🧩 Headline: “Aspiring AML/KYC Analyst | Compliance Enthusiast” 🧩 About Section: Mention your learning journey 🧩 Share your insights as you go — recruiters are watching.🔹 Step 4: Apply + Learn at the Same Time Start with entry-level roles like: • AML Trainee • Compliance Intern • KYC Onboarding Assistant💬 Every interview is practice. Every rejection is a lesson.🔹 Step 5: Network With Intention Follow Compliance professionals. Comment on posts. DM respectfully. Join AML/KYC groups.🧠 You don’t need everyone. Just the right few.💡 The AML/KYC field doesn’t reward perfection. It rewards consistency, curiosity, and clarity.📢 If this gave you a push, share it — You never know who else is ready to leap but just needs a nudge.hashtag#AML hashtag#KYC hashtag#FinCrime hashtag#ComplianceCareers hashtag#BreakIntoCompliance hashtag#AntiMoneyLaundering hashtag#CareerTips hashtag#LinkedInLearning hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#ComplianceCommunity

Nathan EdwardsNathan Edwards,,"6 months in — a quick look at what’s happened… and just WOW.Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked closely with 54 professionals.Here’s what’s happened so far:✅ 46.3% have already received job offers✅ 38.89% of those have signed (some are still in negotiations)Each person came in with a different story — some actively job hunting, others simply exploring or feeling stuck.But one consistent theme across nearly every profile?Minimal responses. Limited visible opportunities.Considering a lot of these candidates are passive, and including quiet periods like December and Ramadan, the results feel even more special.So, what’s made most difference? To name a few key areas:- Being honest about where people are and what’s possible- Showing that there are opportunities — for everyone- Helping candidates position themselves clearly and effectively- Focusing on the shifts that actually make a differenceThis isn’t about quick wins. It’s about building confidence, clarity, and momentum — with a real, tailored approach and get the right opportunity.If you’re in a transition phase or just not sure what’s next, feel free to drop me a message.No pressure. No hard pitch. Just a chat.And to everyone who’s trusted me with their journey so far — thank you 🙏Please Like this post incase someone in your network needs to see this! 👍hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Coaching hashtag#ThinkTalent hashtag#Hiring

Mayur LohiteMayur Lohite,,".NET Core TipStruggling with spam in your lead or contact forms, even with CAPTCHA in place? Here’s a quick tip to help reduce unwanted submissions effectively.Dealing with spam in your lead or contact forms can be incredibly frustrating. But don't worry, there's a solution!Using .NET Core 8.0 MVC, I'll show you how to effectively block spam submissions. The logic applies to any technology, so you can adapt it to your needs.Here's a typical contact/lead form:<form asp-action=""contact"" asp-controller=""home"" method=""post""> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""FullName"" placeholder=""Your Name"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""email"" maxlength=""255"" asp-for=""Email"" placeholder=""Your Mail"" required> <input class=""form-control"" type=""text"" pattern=""^[0-9]*$"" maxlength=""15"" asp-for=""Phone"" placeholder=""Your Phone with country code""> <textarea class=""form-control"" asp-for=""Message"" cols=""40"" rows=""5"" maxlength=""1000"" placeholder=""Your Message"" required></textarea></form>Spammers use automated scripts to find and submit these forms, flooding your inbox with spam. To fight this, we will add a hidden input field to form:<input class=""additional-note"" type=""text"" style=""display:none;"">When the form is submitted, we check if this hidden field is empty. If it is, the submission is likely from a human. If not, it's probably spam.Here's the controller logic:[HttpPost(""contact"")][ValidateReCaptcha]public async Task<IActionResult> Contact(LeadModel model){ if (!ModelState.IsValid) return View(); try { bool result = await _contactService.SaveLead(model); TempData[""success""] = result ? ""We have received your request, we will get back to you shortly!"" : ""Sorry! We are not able to save your request.""; return RedirectToAction(""contact"", ""home""); } catch (Exception ex) { TempData[""fail""] = ""Sorry! Something went wrong to save your request.""; _logger.LogError(ex, $""An error occurred to save lead - {Helper.Dump(model)}""); } return View();}And the business logic service:public async Task<bool> SaveLead(LeadModel? leadModel){ if (leadModel == null || !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(leadModel.RepeatLead)) return false; var lead = _mapper.Map<Lead?>(leadModel); return await _contactRepository.SaveLead(lead);}Implement this simple trick to keep your forms spam-free and ensure you only get genuine leads. 🚀💬 What do you think of this approach? Have you tried something similar? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to share this post with your friends and colleagues who might find it useful. Let's help each other keep our forms spam-free! 💪hashtag#spamprevention hashtag#dotetcore hashtag#leadform hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#leadgeneration hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp

You carry one thing in your bag — a Swiss Army Knife.Why?Because it has everything — scissors, a knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, and more.That’s exactly what FCL is for a .NET developer.A one-stop toolbox that helps you build your app without reinventing the wheel every time.What is FCL (Framework Class Library)?It’s a collection of ready-made classes, interfaces, and value types that provide core functionalities like: •	Reading files •	Working with databases •	Displaying data on screen •	Encrypting information •	Sending messages & more😇Why should you care?Because without FCL, you’d be writing 100s of lines of code just to read a text file or make an API call.Real-Life Analogy:Need to fix your glasses?Grab the mini screwdriver from your Swiss knife — no need to carry a full toolbox.Need to parse a JSON in .NET?Use System.Text.Json from FCL — no need to write your own parser.So, next time you open Visual Studio, remember:FCL is your Swiss Army Knife — making your developer journey lighter, faster, and smarter!Have you discovered any hidden gem in FCL that made your day easier?Drop it in the comments!hashtag#DotNet hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#FCL hashtag#CodingSimplified hashtag#DevLife hashtag#CleanCode

Muskan RaiMuskan Rai,,"🚨 Want to break into AML/KYC but have ZERO experience?Let me be real with you: Most of us in Compliance started out clueless about what PEPs, UBOs, or Sanctions Lists even were.So if you're starting from scratch — you're not behind. You're just early. Here's how to turn “no experience” into your biggest asset: 👇🔹 Step 1: Learn the Language Spend just a week getting familiar with key terms like: CDD, EDD, PEP, UBO, Red Flags, Sanctions, SARs. 🎯 Tip: If you can explain these to a friend, you’re already ahead of 80% of applicants.🔹 Step 2: Take One Small Certification You don't need to spend $$$. Even a LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, or ACAMS free webinar course can help show you're serious.🔹 Step 3: Talk Like You’re Already In Update your LinkedIn: 🧩 Headline: “Aspiring AML/KYC Analyst | Compliance Enthusiast” 🧩 About Section: Mention your learning journey 🧩 Share your insights as you go — recruiters are watching.🔹 Step 4: Apply + Learn at the Same Time Start with entry-level roles like: • AML Trainee • Compliance Intern • KYC Onboarding Assistant💬 Every interview is practice. Every rejection is a lesson.🔹 Step 5: Network With Intention Follow Compliance professionals. Comment on posts. DM respectfully. Join AML/KYC groups.🧠 You don’t need everyone. Just the right few.💡 The AML/KYC field doesn’t reward perfection. It rewards consistency, curiosity, and clarity.📢 If this gave you a push, share it — You never know who else is ready to leap but just needs a nudge.hashtag#AML hashtag#KYC hashtag#FinCrime hashtag#ComplianceCareers hashtag#BreakIntoCompliance hashtag#AntiMoneyLaundering hashtag#CareerTips hashtag#LinkedInLearning hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#ComplianceCommunity
