Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives.

But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?

Nabiha K.Nabiha K.,,"Not all HR is strategic. But it can be.A while back, we started noticing a pattern in feedback from our new hires at Codistan:‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt a complaint, just an honest reflection. And honestly, it stuck with me.So I sat with Javeria Rafique, who handles our talent acquisition with so much heart, and Muhammad Shehrayar Khan, who looks after both IT support and our HRIS/ATS setup. We had a simple goal: let‚Äôs make joining feel smoother.We didn‚Äôt go big. Just: * Shared a clear ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù for Day 1 * Made sure logins and HRIS access were ready before the person arrived *Added a bit of structure and support for that first-day experienceAnd the difference? Huge. People felt more confident, less anxious and actually excited to start.Sometimes it‚Äôs not about big initiatives. It‚Äôs about small, thoughtful moments that make someone feel seen.Would love to know , what‚Äôs one small thing your team changed that made a real impact?
