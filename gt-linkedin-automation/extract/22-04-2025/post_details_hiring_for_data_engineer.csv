Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring.

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking

Helios De LamoHelios De Lamo,,"✍️The structure of high-performing data teams is evolving — and context is everything.🧠As a CDO in the banking sector, I see firsthand how the right data team composition depends heavily on company size, regulatory environment, and data maturity.The recent benchmark shared on the balance between Insights (46%), Data Engineering (43%), and Machine Learning (11%) resonates — but I’d add a few reflections based on experience leading data transformations in both traditional and digital banking environments:1. In early maturity stages, especially in highly regulated industries like banking, data engineering and governance are foundational. Without robust pipelines, metadata management, lineage tracking, and data quality controls, insights are unreliable — and regulatory risk increases.I often tell teams: “We earn the right to do ML by getting the basics right first.”2. As maturity builds, we focus on embedding analytics across the business — especially in risk, fraud, customer experience, and credit. This is where a strong layer of product analysts and embedded BI starts driving tangible business impact.3. At scale, roles like data product managers, governance leads, and ML engineers become critical — not just to deliver models, but to ensure they’re explainable, monitored, and integrated into decision systems.And increasingly, we’re seeing the need for platform thinking: building reusable data products, not just bespoke dashboards.AI-native tools are already reshaping what’s possible, but I believe the core value still lies in clarity, trust, and alignment between data and business goals.💡No one structure fits all — but understanding your current stage helps you build the right team, at the right time, to deliver real impact.🫵And hey — if you made it to the end: I’m currently hiring. We’re building something exciting, and I’m looking for data stewards, data engineers, and data scientists to join our team.DM me if you’re curious.hashtag#CDO hashtag#BankingInnovation hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#AnalyticsEngineering hashtag#DataStrategy hashtag#DataLeadership hashtag#AIinBanking
