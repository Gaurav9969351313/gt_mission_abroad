Pedro MartinsPedro Martins,,"UI-TARS-1.5 Outperforms OpenAI Operator and Claude’s Computer Use Capability ByteDance has unveiled UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent that sets new benchmarks in GUI automation and virtual task execution.​Built upon a robust vision-language model, UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reinforcement learning to enable a ""think-then-act"" approach. This design allows the agent to reason through tasks before execution, enhancing performance and adaptability in complex environments.​Key achievements of UI-TARS-1.5 include:- Superior Benchmark Performance: Achieved 94.2% accuracy on ScreensSpot-V2 (GUI navigation benchmark) and 61.6% on ScreenSpotPro (complex UI task benchmark), outperforming previous state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Operator and Claude’s CLI-based agents in both low-level UI control and strategic planning.- Zero-shot Game Mastery: Achieved 100% success on 14 out-of-distribution GUI-based mini-games from Poki, demonstrating robust visual understanding and control policies.- Multi-step UI Task Solving: Efficient in long-horizon GUI tasks such as system settings configuration, tool navigation, and application control, without requiring fine-tuning on each app.UI-TARS-1.5 introduces a modular native agent architecture that fuses:- Perception (VLM)- Planning (Rationale Generator)- Memory- Action Execution (Click/Key APIs).This modularity allows the agent to generalize across unseen environment, paving the way for next-gen virtual assistants, automated QA, and enterprise RPA.ℹ️ If you want to explore more please check my comments. hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#AIAgents hashtag#Automation hashtag#RPA

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 48: Custom Exceptions in Java (Course Join and 12th Grade Requirement) 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of custom exceptions in Java, where you can create your own exception class to handle specific error conditions. ✅ How to throw and catch custom exceptions to handle business logic or validation rules (e.g., ensuring a student is in 12th grade before joining a course). ✅ Real-world example of creating a custom exception for enforcing requirements before a student can join a course.🔥 Why It Matters: Custom exceptions help you enforce specific business rules or validation conditions within your application, making your code more expressive and easier to maintain. Instead of relying on generic exception types, you can define custom exceptions that clearly reflect the purpose of the error (e.g., checking for grade requirements). This enhances error handling, improves code readability, and provides more meaningful error messages.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a custom exception class by extending the Exception class. ✔ Throwing a custom exception when a student’s grade is below the required level to join a course (e.g., 12th grade). ✔ Catching and handling custom exceptions in the calling method. ✔ Demonstrating the use of custom exceptions to enforce rules in a real-world scenario like student enrollment.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Antoine MERMETAntoine MERMET,,"Last week at nanoTRONIC, I successfully run a VHDL simulation that handles TM/TC and time synchronization over SpaceWire for an European Space Agency - ESA Earth observation mission.Our FPGA design handles: - SpaceWire I/F based on STAR-Dundee IP - SpaceWire redundancy - SpaceWire packet - CCSDS packet - Packet Utilization Standard (PUS)Figure on the top shows the SpaceWire initialization and transfer of time code (here we used it to received a Pulse Per Second (PPS) from the spacecraft):1. Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2. Our design decodes the TC[9,128] and reception of this particular message is allowed.3.

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force.

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Antoine MERMETAntoine MERMET,,"Last week at nanoTRONIC, I successfully run a VHDL simulation that handles TM/TC and time synchronization over SpaceWire for an European Space Agency - ESA Earth observation mission.Our FPGA design handles: - SpaceWire I/F based on STAR-Dundee IP - SpaceWire redundancy - SpaceWire packet - CCSDS packet - Packet Utilization Standard (PUS)Figure on the top shows the SpaceWire initialization and transfer of time code (here we used it to received a Pulse Per Second (PPS) from the spacecraft):1. Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2. Our design decodes the TC[9,128] and reception of this particular message is allowed.3.

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

And found the story she hadn’t told.She had flown home to care for her father Slipped away like a quiet tide, Juggling hospital visits by day, Work calls by night.Not a word of it reached us. Not because she didn’t trust us, But because she thought we’d see her differently. As unreliable. As complicated.But the truth? She had been a lighthouse. Steady, dependable, unshaken— Even as the storm swirled around her.She didn’t ask for help. She didn’t ask for grace. She just kept showing up.So we gave her what she hadn’t asked for: Support.

Pedro MartinsPedro Martins,,"UI-TARS-1.5 Outperforms OpenAI Operator and Claude’s Computer Use Capability ByteDance has unveiled UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent that sets new benchmarks in GUI automation and virtual task execution.​Built upon a robust vision-language model, UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reinforcement learning to enable a ""think-then-act"" approach. This design allows the agent to reason through tasks before execution, enhancing performance and adaptability in complex environments.​Key achievements of UI-TARS-1.5 include:- Superior Benchmark Performance: Achieved 94.2% accuracy on ScreensSpot-V2 (GUI navigation benchmark) and 61.6% on ScreenSpotPro (complex UI task benchmark), outperforming previous state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Operator and Claude’s CLI-based agents in both low-level UI control and strategic planning.- Zero-shot Game Mastery: Achieved 100% success on 14 out-of-distribution GUI-based mini-games from Poki, demonstrating robust visual understanding and control policies.- Multi-step UI Task Solving: Efficient in long-horizon GUI tasks such as system settings configuration, tool navigation, and application control, without requiring fine-tuning on each app.UI-TARS-1.5 introduces a modular native agent architecture that fuses:- Perception (VLM)- Planning (Rationale Generator)- Memory- Action Execution (Click/Key APIs).This modularity allows the agent to generalize across unseen environment, paving the way for next-gen virtual assistants, automated QA, and enterprise RPA.ℹ️ If you want to explore more please check my comments. hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#AIAgents hashtag#Automation hashtag#RPA

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Simulation generates Din & Sin and sends specific characters to our design at 10Mbps.2. Our design is doing the same with Dout & Sout.3. Once both received the expected characters sequence, the SpaceWire connection is initialized and switches to its nominal speed.4. Simulation transfers a time-code.5. Our design decodes the time code and generates an internal PPS signal for our Local On Board Time (LOBT) design.The next figure shows transfer of a telecommand TC[9,128] that contains the time needed by the LOBT for the next PPS:1. Simulation transfers a TC[9,128] to our design (including PUS header, CCSDS packet and SpaceWire packet encapsulation).2.

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Not in theory. In practice.With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Claude isn’t just answering prompts. It’s thinking across tools, files, APIs, and even geography, all at once.Here’s what I’ve wired up so far:𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐌𝐂𝐏Claude can read and write directly from my folders. It knows what I’m working on without needing me to explain.𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐌𝐂𝐏Real-time web results plus Claude’s logic equals smarter, more grounded responses.𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐌𝐂𝐏Reviewing code, checking issues, referencing commits. Claude’s in the repo with me. Mostly prototypes, but still counts.𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐂𝐏This one’s underrated. It keeps track of multi-step thought processes like a strategist, not just a chatbot.𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐥 𝐌𝐂𝐏It can scrape and structure any website I point it to. Basically, a personal research intern.𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐬 𝐌𝐂𝐏Claude can now “see” locations and plan things geographically.𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧Conversational memory that actually works. It doesn’t just respond. It remembers.𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 + 𝐙𝐞𝐝Feels like pair programming with an all-knowing dev buddy.Put all that together and what you get isn’t just productivity. It’s orchestration.And there are still way more MCP servers that I still didn’t integrate and way more that are yet to be developed!AI isn’t about prompts anymore. It’s about context, continuity, and capability. Claude’s MCP is a huge step in that direction.Jarvis who? Let’s just say the future feels less sci-fi and more boot up and get to work.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Let me know if you'd like a detailed example or if you have any questions!Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Pedro MartinsPedro Martins,,"UI-TARS-1.5 Outperforms OpenAI Operator and Claude’s Computer Use Capability ByteDance has unveiled UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent that sets new benchmarks in GUI automation and virtual task execution.​Built upon a robust vision-language model, UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reinforcement learning to enable a ""think-then-act"" approach. This design allows the agent to reason through tasks before execution, enhancing performance and adaptability in complex environments.​Key achievements of UI-TARS-1.5 include:- Superior Benchmark Performance: Achieved 94.2% accuracy on ScreensSpot-V2 (GUI navigation benchmark) and 61.6% on ScreenSpotPro (complex UI task benchmark), outperforming previous state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Operator and Claude’s CLI-based agents in both low-level UI control and strategic planning.- Zero-shot Game Mastery: Achieved 100% success on 14 out-of-distribution GUI-based mini-games from Poki, demonstrating robust visual understanding and control policies.- Multi-step UI Task Solving: Efficient in long-horizon GUI tasks such as system settings configuration, tool navigation, and application control, without requiring fine-tuning on each app.UI-TARS-1.5 introduces a modular native agent architecture that fuses:- Perception (VLM)- Planning (Rationale Generator)- Memory- Action Execution (Click/Key APIs).This modularity allows the agent to generalize across unseen environment, paving the way for next-gen virtual assistants, automated QA, and enterprise RPA.ℹ️ If you want to explore more please check my comments. hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#AIAgents hashtag#Automation hashtag#RPA

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds.

And found the story she hadn’t told.She had flown home to care for her father Slipped away like a quiet tide, Juggling hospital visits by day, Work calls by night.Not a word of it reached us. Not because she didn’t trust us, But because she thought we’d see her differently. As unreliable. As complicated.But the truth? She had been a lighthouse. Steady, dependable, unshaken— Even as the storm swirled around her.She didn’t ask for help. She didn’t ask for grace. She just kept showing up.So we gave her what she hadn’t asked for: Support. Flexibility. Better tools. And a little light back in her direction.The client never left. Never even blinked.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in Simple Math 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A,Dr Sagar Gulati

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Abdelrahman MohamedAbdelrahman Mohamed,,"𝗔𝗹𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵Hello everyone.Have you ever wondered how the multi-core processor in your machine can boost your verification performance?Here’s something practical that might surprise you:Instead of running multiple sequences sequentially in a single test (e.g., 4 sequences taking X seconds total), you can parallelize them across multiple tests — each running on a different core.💡 If you split the 4 sequences into 4 parallel tests, the total runtime can drop to approximately (1/4) × X seconds, assuming you have at least 4 CPU cores.It’s a simple and powerful way to leverage your hardware efficiently — especially for long regressions or complex scenarios.🧠 The only limit is how many cores your machine has!You can check out a practical example in my GitHub repo: 👉

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Not in theory. In practice.With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Claude isn’t just answering prompts. It’s thinking across tools, files, APIs, and even geography, all at once.Here’s what I’ve wired up so far:𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐌𝐂𝐏Claude can read and write directly from my folders.

It’s orchestration.And there are still way more MCP servers that I still didn’t integrate and way more that are yet to be developed!AI isn’t about prompts anymore. It’s about context, continuity, and capability. Claude’s MCP is a huge step in that direction.Jarvis who? Let’s just say the future feels less sci-fi and more boot up and get to work.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data.

A reply at 2am. A timezone that didn’t quite add up. A client raised an eyebrow.So we followed the thread. And found the story she hadn’t told.She had flown home to care for her father Slipped away like a quiet tide, Juggling hospital visits by day, Work calls by night.Not a word of it reached us. Not because she didn’t trust us, But because she thought we’d see her differently. As unreliable. As complicated.But the truth? She had been a lighthouse. Steady, dependable, unshaken— Even as the storm swirled around her.She didn’t ask for help. She didn’t ask for grace. She just kept showing up.So we gave her what she hadn’t asked for: Support. Flexibility. Better tools. And a little light back in her direction.The client never left. Never even blinked. Because what mattered wasn’t the time on the clock It was the trust she built, hour by hour.Here’s what I’ve learned:Remote work isn’t about where you are. It’s about how you show up.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in Simple Math 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A,Dr Sagar Gulati

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Kavya AKavya A,,"💻 Day 43: Single Inheritance in Java 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of single inheritance, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a single superclass. ✅ How single inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and modularity. ✅ Real-world example of single inheritance (e.g., an Animal superclass and a Dog subclass where the dog inherits common behaviors from the animal).🔥 Why It Matters: Single inheritance makes code more manageable by promoting reuse. By inheriting common features from a parent class, subclasses don’t need to repeat code, which simplifies maintenance and makes your code more organized. It also allows for extending the behavior of a class without modifying the original code, promoting scalability.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a superclass with common properties and methods. ✔ Implementing a subclass that inherits and extends the functionality of the superclass. ✔ Overriding methods in the subclass to customize behavior (e.g., animal’s generic behavior vs. dog’s specific behavior). ✔ Understanding the inheritance flow and how a subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A, Dr Sagar Gulati

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Pedro MartinsPedro Martins,,"UI-TARS-1.5 Outperforms OpenAI Operator and Claude’s Computer Use Capability ByteDance has unveiled UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent that sets new benchmarks in GUI automation and virtual task execution.​Built upon a robust vision-language model, UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reinforcement learning to enable a ""think-then-act"" approach. This design allows the agent to reason through tasks before execution, enhancing performance and adaptability in complex environments.​Key achievements of UI-TARS-1.5 include:- Superior Benchmark Performance: Achieved 94.2% accuracy on ScreensSpot-V2 (GUI navigation benchmark) and 61.6% on ScreenSpotPro (complex UI task benchmark), outperforming previous state-of-the-art models like OpenAI Operator and Claude’s CLI-based agents in both low-level UI control and strategic planning.- Zero-shot Game Mastery: Achieved 100% success on 14 out-of-distribution GUI-based mini-games from Poki, demonstrating robust visual understanding and control policies.- Multi-step UI Task Solving: Efficient in long-horizon GUI tasks such as system settings configuration, tool navigation, and application control, without requiring fine-tuning on each app.UI-TARS-1.5 introduces a modular native agent architecture that fuses:- Perception (VLM)- Planning (Rationale Generator)- Memory- Action Execution (Click/Key APIs).This modularity allows the agent to generalize across unseen environment, paving the way for next-gen virtual assistants, automated QA, and enterprise RPA.ℹ️ If you want to explore more please check my comments. hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#AIAgents hashtag#Automation hashtag#RPA

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 46: Throw Example in Java 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of using the throw keyword to explicitly throw exceptions in Java. ✅ How to create custom error messages when throwing exceptions to handle specific conditions in your code. ✅ A real-world example of throwing an exception when an invalid input is provided, such as when checking a person's age and ensuring it meets a certain criteria (e.g., age should be 18 or older).🔥 Why It Matters: Using the throw keyword helps enforce rules and conditions in your code. When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Aliza KhanAliza Khan,,"The Rise of Freelancing in Pakistan – A New Economic ForceFreelancing has rapidly become a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, offering a fresh path for income generation, especially among the youth. Here's how it's shaping up as a new economic force:Why Freelancing is Rising in PakistanWith over 60% of the population under 30, many Pakistanis are turning to online platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer to earn independently.Freelancing removes geographical barriers, allowing Pakistanis to work with international clients and earn in foreign currencies like USD, which boosts national foreign reserves.In a country where traditional job opportunities are limited, freelancing offers a flexible and low-barrier alternative to employment.Better internet infrastructure and government/private initiatives offering digital skills training (e.g., DigiSkills.pk) have enabled more people to work online.The pandemic normalized remote work worldwide, pushing both freelancers and clients toward online solutions.Why It MattersFreelancers earn in foreign currencies, contributing directly to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing pressure on the trade balance.Freelancing lets skilled individuals earn globally without leaving the country, keeping talent at home.Freelancers often transition into entrepreneurs, building agencies or startups, which adds to economic dynamism.Freelancing offers income opportunities from home, especially empowering women and those in rural or underdeveloped regions.With proper regulation and tax policy, the government can tap into freelancing as a new tax base.Challenges AheadPayment Gateway Issues (like limited PayPal access)Lack of consistent government policySkills quality and client communication barriersCybersecurity and legal protections for freelancer.ConclusionFreelancing in Pakistan is more than just a trend—it’s a transformational economic force. With the right support, it can help reshape the economy by empowering individuals, bringing in foreign income, and creating a more inclusive job market.hashtag#freelancing

Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data. This includes:RawSensorData: Captures input data and validates it for correctness.NormalizedData: Converts measurements into a standard format.AlertData: Encapsulates the final output, indicating any alerts triggered based on predefined thresholds.4. Building the Pipeline StagesDevelop asynchronous functions that handle the following tasks:Ingestion and Validation: Receive and validate raw sensor data.Normalization: Convert temperature readings from Celsius to Kelvin.Monitoring: Check readings against alert thresholds.Archiving: Store alerts for future analysis.Case Studies and ResultsIn a simulation with various sensor inputs, the system successfully identified and archived alerts based on temperature thresholds. For instance:When a sensor reading exceeded the alert threshold, the system generated and stored an “alert” instance, demonstrating its efficacy in real-time data monitoring.The use of pandas for data...

Sahil DateraoSahil Daterao,,"How do we ensure requirements meet stakeholder expectations? By following the Iterative V-Model — an iterative process to design low level requirement fulfilment review.We begin with stakeholder analysis, capturing mission-aligned needs and shaping them into a clear lifecycle strategy. This leads to the System Requirements Review (SRR), which ensures system requirements are well-formed and aligned with strategic objectives. Next, a system architecture is chosen through trade space exploration, guided by MBSE practices. At this stage, the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) confirms the design aligns with system requirements, risks are acknowledged, interfaces are mapped, and verification methods are baselined.With design details locked, the Critical Design Review (CDR) checks that we’re ready for full-scale integration, confirming technical maturity, feasibility, and alignment with cost and schedule. Then comes the Production Readiness Review (PRR) — a go/no-go for manufacturing. It confirms that readiness of the system developers to efficiently produce the required number of systems. Finally, the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) validates everything — from hardware and software to people and procedures — for a safe, successful launch.Do we share same thoughts when I say, ""the sharpest edge isn’t complexity — it’s assumption?"" well, Reviews keep it blunt.

Satyam Singh KushwahaSatyam Singh Kushwaha,,"In Intune, ""update rings"" refer to a strategy for rolling out Windows updates in stages, allowing administrators to test and refine the deployment process before a broad rollout. The common approach involves using a ""Preview"" ring (formerly ""Pilot"" ring), a ""Limited"" ring, and a ""Broad"" ring. This tiered approach helps minimize disruption and ensure a smooth update experience for the majority of users. Here's a breakdown of the typical update ring deployment strategy:1•Preview (Pilot) Ring:A small group of test devices are assigned to this ring. This allows for initial testing and validation of the update before deploying it to a larger audience. 2•Limited Ring:After the preview ring confirms that the update is stable, the ""Limited"" ring is deployed. This group is larger than the preview ring but still smaller than the overall organization. This provides additional feedback and opportunity to address any issues before broad deployment. 3•Broad Ring: The final ring, the ""Broad"" ring, includes the majority of devices in the organization. The deployment to this ring is usually faster, as the risk of major issues has been minimized by the previous stages. Key Benefits of Update Rings:•Reduced Risk:By deploying updates in stages, organizations can mitigate the risk of widespread issues and disruptions.•Improved Testing:The tiered approach allows for thorough testing and validation of updates in a controlled environment.•Targeted Deployment:Update rings can be configured to target specific devices or groups of users, enabling organizations to tailor the update experience to different needs and priorities.•Enhanced Control:Administrators have granular control over when and how updates are deployed, including the ability to set deferrals and active hours.hashtag#Intune hashtag#Updaterings

When certain conditions are not met (like an invalid age), you can trigger an exception, allowing you to handle these errors appropriately. It adds a layer of control and error management to your program, making it more robust and predictable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Explicitly throwing exceptions using the throw keyword in response to invalid conditions. ✔ Creating custom exception messages to provide more meaningful feedback when an error occurs. ✔ Demonstrating how throwing an exception can stop the normal flow of execution and how you can handle errors by throwing exceptions deliberately. ✔ Understanding the role of exceptions in ensuring your program adheres to specific rules and logic (e.g., age validation).Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 45: Method Overloading in SimpleMath 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of method overloading, where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or number of parameters within the same class. ✅ How method overloading allows the same operation to be performed on different data types (e.g., int vs. double), providing flexibility and readability in the code. ✅ Real-world example of method overloading (e.g., a SimpleMath class with overloaded add(), sub(), and div() methods to handle both integer and floating-point numbers).🔥 Why It Matters: Method overloading improves the versatility of your methods and makes your code more intuitive. Instead of creating multiple method names for similar operations, you can use the same method name with different parameters, keeping your code cleaner and easier to maintain. It helps you handle multiple scenarios with a single logical method name.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating overloaded methods with the same name but different parameter types (e.g., int vs. double). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls based on the number and type of arguments passed. ✔ Demonstrating method overloading with arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division. ✔ Calling overloaded methods with different argument types and observing the results.Jain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Hemanth BcHemanth Bc,,"💻 Day 44: Multilevel Inheritance in Java (Grandparent → Parent → Child) 🧬🔄 What You Explored: ✅ The concept of multilevel inheritance, where a class (Child) inherits from another class (Parent), and that class (Parent) inherits from a third class (Grandparent). ✅ How multilevel inheritance creates a chain of class relationships, allowing subclasses to inherit behavior from multiple levels of the class hierarchy. ✅ Real-world example of multilevel inheritance (e.g., a Grandparent class, a Parent class, and a Child class, where the child inherits behavior from both the parent and the grandparent).🔥 Why It Matters: Multilevel inheritance enables you to build more complex hierarchies of classes, allowing for a more structured and reusable design. It encourages the reuse of code at each level of the hierarchy while also enabling specialization and extension of functionality in subclasses. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Creating a class hierarchy where a subclass inherits from another subclass (Grandparent → Parent → Child). ✔ Understanding how each subclass can access properties and methods of its parent and grandparent classes. ✔ Demonstrating method inheritance and overriding in a multilevel context (e.g., showGrandparent(), showParent(), showChild()). ✔ Understanding how Java resolves method calls through the chain of inheritance.Jain (Deemed-to-be University)Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.ADr Sagar Gulati

Amarachi Mercy OkereAmarachi Mercy Okere,,"🚀 My Journey with GitHub, Git Actions, and CI/CD PipelinesI recently worked on a project where I set up a complete development pipeline using GitHub, Git Actions, and AWS. Here's a breakdown of the process:📥 I started by downloading a free CSS template, unzipping it, and organizing the files into a new folder. Then, I launched the project in VS Code using the terminal command code . to get started.🛠️ For version control, I initialized a Git repository with git init, staged and committed my changes with git add . and git commit -m ""Initial commit"". I renamed the default branch to main and pushed everything to a private GitHub repo using git push origin main.🌐 Next, I created an AWS EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I installed Nginx on the instance with the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx⚙️ In VS Code, I set up a .github folder with a cicd.yml file, defining a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment job (deploy-to-server-01 → deploy-to-server-04) runs sequentially, automatically triggering after each commit to the main branch.🎥 Below is a video of my work where you can see the pipeline in action and how it all comes together.💬 Key Takeaways:✔️  GitHub Actions simplified automating deployment, making it faster and error-free.✔️  AWS EC2 provided reliable cloud infrastructure for hosting my project.✔️  CI/CD pipelines are invaluable in streamlining development workflows and automating deployments, ensuring smooth updates to production.I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques!

Utilizing FastStream, RabbitMQ, and TestRabbitBroker, we can demonstrate an efficient, in-memory architecture that simulates a message broker without needing external resources. This approach is highly valuable for businesses seeking to enhance their data processing capabilities.Key ComponentsFastStream FrameworkFastStream is a high-performance, Python-native stream processing framework that enables seamless data flow management. By integrating with RabbitMQ, it provides a robust backbone for our alert pipeline.Message Broker IntegrationUsing RabbitBroker and TestRabbitBroker, businesses can simulate message handling in a controlled environment. This allows teams to effectively prototype and test their applications before deployment.Pydantic for Data ValidationPydantic models ensure data quality and type safety at each stage of the pipeline, leading to more reliable output. This is especially crucial for businesses where accurate data processing is essential.Implementation Steps1. Installing Required PackagesStart by installing FastStream with RabbitMQ integration and the nest_asyncio package, which enables nested asynchronous event loops within environments like Google Colab.2. Configuring the Logging SystemSet up a logger to trace pipeline execution. Detailed logging helps identify issues and monitor performance throughout the process.3. Defining Data ModelsUtilize Pydantic to define schemas for the incoming and processed data.

And found the story she hadn’t told.She had flown home to care for her father Slipped away like a quiet tide, Juggling hospital visits by day, Work calls by night.Not a word of it reached us. Not because she didn’t trust us, But because she thought we’d see her differently. As unreliable. As complicated.But the truth? She had been a lighthouse. Steady, dependable, unshaken— Even as the storm swirled around her.She didn’t ask for help. She didn’t ask for grace. She just kept showing up.So we gave her what she hadn’t asked for: Support. Flexibility. Better tools. And a little light back in her direction.The client never left. Never even blinked.

Sahil DateraoSahil Daterao,,"How do we ensure requirements meet stakeholder expectations? By following the Iterative V-Model — an iterative process to design low level requirement fulfilment review.We begin with stakeholder analysis, capturing mission-aligned needs and shaping them into a clear lifecycle strategy. This leads to the System Requirements Review (SRR), which ensures system requirements are well-formed and aligned with strategic objectives. Next, a system architecture is chosen through trade space exploration, guided by MBSE practices. At this stage, the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) confirms the design aligns with system requirements, risks are acknowledged, interfaces are mapped, and verification methods are baselined.With design details locked, the Critical Design Review (CDR) checks that we’re ready for full-scale integration, confirming technical maturity, feasibility, and alignment with cost and schedule. Then comes the Production Readiness Review (PRR) — a go/no-go for manufacturing. It confirms that readiness of the system developers to efficiently produce the required number of systems. Finally, the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) validates everything — from hardware and software to people and procedures — for a safe, successful launch.Do we share same thoughts when I say, ""the sharpest edge isn’t complexity — it’s assumption?"" well, Reviews keep it blunt.

Mohamed AshrafMohamed Ashraf,,"الفرق بين أنواع الـ SFP وأنواع السرعات !لو شغال في الشبكات أو بتتعلم، أكيد سمعت عن حاجة اسمها SFP ووقفت قدامك أنواع كتير زي SFP، SFP+، SFP28، QSFP…طيب إيه الفرق بينهم؟ وإمتى أستخدم ده أو ده؟تعالى نفهمها مع بعض ببساطة:أولًا: يعني إيه SFP؟كلمة SFP اختصار لـ Small Form-factor Pluggable، وده ببساطة موديل صغير بيتوصل في السويتش أو الراوتر عشان يركب فيه كابل فايبر أو كابل نحاسي (RJ45).يعني هو عبارة عن ""مدخل قابل للتبديل"" بدل ما تشتري سويتش مخصوص لنوع معين من الكابلات.الأنواع والسرعات:SFP:السرعة: حتى 1Gbpsبيشتغل على: فايبر أو كابل نحاسي (حسب النوع)مناسب للشبكات الصغيرة أو الربط بين الأجهزة على مسافات بسيطة.SFP+:السرعة: حتى 10Gbpsبيشتغل على: فايبر غالبًا، لكن فيه منه نسخة RJ45منتشر جدًا في الداتا سنترز والشركات المتوسطة والكبيرة.SFP28:السرعة: حتى 25Gbpsبيستخدم فايبر متطور أو DAC cablesمناسب للـ high performance والـ storage networks.QSFP:السرعة: حتى 40Gbpsبيكون حجمه أكبر من الـ SFP العاديبيشتغل على 4 قنوات × 10Gbpsمناسب للربط بين سويتشات داتا سنتر كبيرة.QSFP28:السرعة: حتى 100Gbpsبيشتغل على 4 قنوات × 25Gbpsده وحش الشبكات الكبيرة والـ cloud infrastructure.طب إزاي أختار؟- لو شغلك شبكات داخلية بسيطة: SFP (1G) كفاية- لو داتا سنتر أو بنية تحتية محترمة: SFP+ (10G) أو أعلى- لو السرعة عندك أولوية قصوى: SFP28 أو QSFP حسب طبيعة الشبكةملحوظة مهمة:الـ Transceiver يعني وحدة الـ SFP نفسها لازم يكون متوافق مع نوع السويتش، ومش أي نوع يشتغل على أي جهاز.كمان النوع بيتحدد على حسب المسافة اللي هتوصلها:- في SFPs لمسافات قصيرة (SR)- في لمسافات طويلة (LR)وفي لمسافات تصل لعشرات الكيلومترات (ER/ZR)الخلاصة:النوع: SFPالسرعة: 1 Gbpsالاستخدام: شبكات داخلية بسيطةالنوع: SFP+السرعة: 10 Gbpsالاستخدام: داتا سنتر وشبكات متوسطة وكبيرةالنوع: SFP28السرعة: 25 Gbpsالاستخدام: أداء عالي – تخزين – Cloudالنوع: QSFP+السرعة: 40Gbpsالاستخدام: ربط سويتشات قوية في داتا سنترالنوع: QSFP28السرعة: 100 Gbpsالاستخدام: أقصى أداء لشبكات ضخمة ومراكز بيانات
