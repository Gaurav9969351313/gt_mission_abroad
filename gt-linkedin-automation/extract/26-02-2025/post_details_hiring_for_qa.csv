After months of applying, interviewing, and perfecting the art of responding to “Where do you see yourself in five years?” with something deeper than “Hopefully employed,” I’m again crowd-sourcing my next great opportunity.I’m a seasoned Quality Assurance Leader with over a decade of experience ensuring software does what it’s supposed to (and not whatever chaos it dreams up at 2 AM). I specialize in risk-based testing, API testing, automation and team leadership, and I love making products better, faster, and less likely to break in production.So, if you or someone you know is hiring for QA leadership, test strategy, or software quality management, let’s chat! I promise I’m a great hire—I even bring my own memes.💬 Drop me a message, leave a comment, or send a carrier pigeon (though email works too). Let’s get me back to breaking things before customers do.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#HireMe hashtag#LookingForWork hashtag#HelpWanted hashtag#OpenToWork

Ethel SarkodieEthel Sarkodie,,"In software QA, collaboration is key to delivering quality products. If a team member feels excluded, start by fostering open communication in daily stand ups or retrospectives. Actively involve them in test planning, bug triages, and peer reviews to ensure their voice is heard. Encourage knowledge-sharing through pair testing or mentorship to strengthen team connections. Recognize their contributions in meetings and documentation to reinforce their value. Leading by example, promote a culture where every tester, developer, and stakeholder collaborates seamlessly.

Zackary SkellyZackary Skelly,,"📝 Q4 Crypto Job Trends & What's Ahead in 2025Digging into our portfolio data again (and releasing insights every half). Some interesting shifts in both talent and hiring these past few months… 👇—————————📈 2024 was way bigger than '23 for crypto jobs, overall — our portfolio companies added 80% more roles vs last year.Huge spike in Aug/Sept (mix of mid-year planning + political hype?) before the usual Q4 holiday slowdown (standard seasonal cycles).📊 By the numbers:* YoY23Q4: Total 436 jobs addedOct: 149 | Nov: 174 | Dec: 11324Q4: Total 788 jobs added (+80%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188* QoQ24Q3: Total 902 jobs addedJul: 208 | Aug: 345 | Sept: 34924Q4: Total 788 jobs added (-13%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188—————————🗳️ Election impact on hiring proved lagging — small Nov bump, but mostly dominated by normal EOY patterns. Thinking the real effects on hiring will continue playing out through H1 2025, and we're following both policy shifts and talent moves closely. 👀—————————🧑‍💻 As for candidates in Q4, we saw the standard seasonal dip there, too, with folks mostly networking vs actively applying. Overall sentiment's strong, though, with curiosity high and int'l talent/roles shifting (back) to the US. NYC especially heating up.And some things carried over from Q3: > Web2 engineers keep testing Web3 waters, but most have been harder to convert. > Top IC talent is still wary of early-stage, and > Lots of non-tech folks are on the market after pivots/layoffs, prioritizing stability.—————————On the portfolio side, nearly all roles grew YoY, with design and QA flat, and legal/compliance & people/recruiting surging (US reg prep & growth planning).~All roles dipped in Q4, w/ a surprising spike in TPM asks.Now, seeing early signals on eng leader and BD roles. 💡—————————📌 What This Means for H1 Hiring:> Keep passive leads warm — many still watching and waiting> Optimize for non-tech — many on the market> Fine-tune your pitch — esp token offers> Culture is key — clarify values & growth paths> Policy shifts may hit fast — stay ahead—————————Final thoughts: Despite the standard seasonal slowdown, market fundamentals and YoY industry growth remain strong. Key areas to watch: AIxCrypto, alt L1s, and US policy developments. What have y’all been seeing?

Zackary SkellyZackary Skelly,,"📝 Q4 Crypto Job Trends & What's Ahead in 2025Digging into our portfolio data again (and releasing insights every half). Some interesting shifts in both talent and hiring these past few months… 👇—————————📈 2024 was way bigger than '23 for crypto jobs, overall — our portfolio companies added 80% more roles vs last year.Huge spike in Aug/Sept (mix of mid-year planning + political hype?) before the usual Q4 holiday slowdown (standard seasonal cycles).📊 By the numbers:* YoY23Q4: Total 436 jobs addedOct: 149 | Nov: 174 | Dec: 11324Q4: Total 788 jobs added (+80%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188* QoQ24Q3: Total 902 jobs addedJul: 208 | Aug: 345 | Sept: 34924Q4: Total 788 jobs added (-13%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188—————————🗳️ Election impact on hiring proved lagging — small Nov bump, but mostly dominated by normal EOY patterns. Thinking the real effects on hiring will continue playing out through H1 2025, and we're following both policy shifts and talent moves closely. 👀—————————🧑‍💻 As for candidates in Q4, we saw the standard seasonal dip there, too, with folks mostly networking vs actively applying. Overall sentiment's strong, though, with curiosity high and int'l talent/roles shifting (back) to the US. NYC especially heating up.And some things carried over from Q3: > Web2 engineers keep testing Web3 waters, but most have been harder to convert. > Top IC talent is still wary of early-stage, and > Lots of non-tech folks are on the market after pivots/layoffs, prioritizing stability.—————————On the portfolio side, nearly all roles grew YoY, with design and QA flat, and legal/compliance & people/recruiting surging (US reg prep & growth planning).~All roles dipped in Q4, w/ a surprising spike in TPM asks.Now, seeing early signals on eng leader and BD roles. 💡—————————📌 What This Means for H1 Hiring:> Keep passive leads warm — many still watching and waiting> Optimize for non-tech — many on the market> Fine-tune your pitch — esp token offers> Culture is key — clarify values & growth paths> Policy shifts may hit fast — stay ahead—————————Final thoughts: Despite the standard seasonal slowdown, market fundamentals and YoY industry growth remain strong. Key areas to watch: AIxCrypto, alt L1s, and US policy developments. What have y’all been seeing?

Zackary SkellyZackary Skelly,,"📝 Q4 Crypto Job Trends & What's Ahead in 2025Digging into our portfolio data again (and releasing insights every half). Some interesting shifts in both talent and hiring these past few months… 👇—————————📈 2024 was way bigger than '23 for crypto jobs, overall — our portfolio companies added 80% more roles vs last year.Huge spike in Aug/Sept (mix of mid-year planning + political hype?) before the usual Q4 holiday slowdown (standard seasonal cycles).📊 By the numbers:* YoY23Q4: Total 436 jobs addedOct: 149 | Nov: 174 | Dec: 11324Q4: Total 788 jobs added (+80%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188* QoQ24Q3: Total 902 jobs addedJul: 208 | Aug: 345 | Sept: 34924Q4: Total 788 jobs added (-13%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188—————————🗳️ Election impact on hiring proved lagging — small Nov bump, but mostly dominated by normal EOY patterns. Thinking the real effects on hiring will continue playing out through H1 2025, and we're following both policy shifts and talent moves closely. 👀—————————🧑‍💻 As for candidates in Q4, we saw the standard seasonal dip there, too, with folks mostly networking vs actively applying. Overall sentiment's strong, though, with curiosity high and int'l talent/roles shifting (back) to the US. NYC especially heating up.And some things carried over from Q3: > Web2 engineers keep testing Web3 waters, but most have been harder to convert. > Top IC talent is still wary of early-stage, and > Lots of non-tech folks are on the market after pivots/layoffs, prioritizing stability.—————————On the portfolio side, nearly all roles grew YoY, with design and QA flat, and legal/compliance & people/recruiting surging (US reg prep & growth planning).~All roles dipped in Q4, w/ a surprising spike in TPM asks.Now, seeing early signals on eng leader and BD roles. 💡—————————📌 What This Means for H1 Hiring:> Keep passive leads warm — many still watching and waiting> Optimize for non-tech — many on the market> Fine-tune your pitch — esp token offers> Culture is key — clarify values & growth paths> Policy shifts may hit fast — stay ahead—————————Final thoughts: Despite the standard seasonal slowdown, market fundamentals and YoY industry growth remain strong. Key areas to watch: AIxCrypto, alt L1s, and US policy developments. What have y’all been seeing?

After months of applying, interviewing, and perfecting the art of responding to “Where do you see yourself in five years?” with something deeper than “Hopefully employed,” I’m again crowd-sourcing my next great opportunity.I’m a seasoned Quality Assurance Leader with over a decade of experience ensuring software does what it’s supposed to (and not whatever chaos it dreams up at 2 AM). I specialize in risk-based testing, API testing, automation and team leadership, and I love making products better, faster, and less likely to break in production.So, if you or someone you know is hiring for QA leadership, test strategy, or software quality management, let’s chat! I promise I’m a great hire—I even bring my own memes.💬 Drop me a message, leave a comment, or send a carrier pigeon (though email works too). Let’s get me back to breaking things before customers do.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QA hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#HireMe hashtag#LookingForWork hashtag#HelpWanted hashtag#OpenToWork

Zackary SkellyZackary Skelly,,"📝 Q4 Crypto Job Trends & What's Ahead in 2025Digging into our portfolio data again (and releasing insights every half). Some interesting shifts in both talent and hiring these past few months… 👇—————————📈 2024 was way bigger than '23 for crypto jobs, overall — our portfolio companies added 80% more roles vs last year.Huge spike in Aug/Sept (mix of mid-year planning + political hype?) before the usual Q4 holiday slowdown (standard seasonal cycles).📊 By the numbers:* YoY23Q4: Total 436 jobs addedOct: 149 | Nov: 174 | Dec: 11324Q4: Total 788 jobs added (+80%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188* QoQ24Q3: Total 902 jobs addedJul: 208 | Aug: 345 | Sept: 34924Q4: Total 788 jobs added (-13%)Oct: 286 | Nov: 314 | Dec: 188—————————🗳️ Election impact on hiring proved lagging — small Nov bump, but mostly dominated by normal EOY patterns. Thinking the real effects on hiring will continue playing out through H1 2025, and we're following both policy shifts and talent moves closely. 👀—————————🧑‍💻 As for candidates in Q4, we saw the standard seasonal dip there, too, with folks mostly networking vs actively applying. Overall sentiment's strong, though, with curiosity high and int'l talent/roles shifting (back) to the US. NYC especially heating up.And some things carried over from Q3: > Web2 engineers keep testing Web3 waters, but most have been harder to convert. > Top IC talent is still wary of early-stage, and > Lots of non-tech folks are on the market after pivots/layoffs, prioritizing stability.—————————On the portfolio side, nearly all roles grew YoY, with design and QA flat, and legal/compliance & people/recruiting surging (US reg prep & growth planning).~All roles dipped in Q4, w/ a surprising spike in TPM asks.Now, seeing early signals on eng leader and BD roles. 💡—————————📌 What This Means for H1 Hiring:> Keep passive leads warm — many still watching and waiting> Optimize for non-tech — many on the market> Fine-tune your pitch — esp token offers> Culture is key — clarify values & growth paths> Policy shifts may hit fast — stay ahead—————————Final thoughts: Despite the standard seasonal slowdown, market fundamentals and YoY industry growth remain strong. Key areas to watch: AIxCrypto, alt L1s, and US policy developments. What have y’all been seeing?
