Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Most companies say they’re “data-driven.” They’re not. They’re data-aware at best - collecting numbers, running reports, and doing absolutely nothing with them.The problem? Tech and business don’t speak the same language. Engineers build systems, People Teams collects metrics, and leadership still makes hiring decisions based on gut feel. It’s 2025. That’s insane.A recent CIO article nailed it: being “data-forward” isn’t about tech - it’s about integration. And for People teams, that means using tech to stop playing defense and start shaping the business.Where People and Tech actually need to talk:💼 Hiring & Onboarding – AI-backed recruiting (Eightfold, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, TeamTailor) is predicting talent needs before hiring managers even know they exist. Automated onboarding (Enboarder, Sapling, Hibob, Talmundo) actually makes new hires want to stay.📊 Core HR & Workforce Mobility – Platforms like HiBob, BambooHR, Rippling, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors aren’t just HR software - they’re business alignment tools. Internal mobility solutions (Gloat, Reejig) mean fewer exit interviews, more promotions.📣Employee Engagement & Experience – Want to know why people are disengaged? Ask them. In real time. Tools like Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice and Peakon turn employee sentiment into action and through platforms like Bonusly you can boost their engagement.Most People teams don’t need more dashboards. They need a seat at the strategy table. And that only happens when People, Tech, and Leadership stop speaking in silos and start using data the way marketing, sales, and product already do.So - are you actually data-forward, or just using People tech as a digital filing cabinet?
