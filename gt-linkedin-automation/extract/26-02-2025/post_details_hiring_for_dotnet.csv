Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Sage LalSage Lal,lals@wolvcoll.ac.uk,"Mastering hashtag#FullStackDevelopment with hashtag#Django!Web development has come a long way, and so has my journey with it! From building my first website in 1998 for Stow Heath Primary School (thanks to Dave Whyley and Gavin Hawkins) to teaching dynamic web design at Bilston College in 1999, I’ve seen the industry evolve drastically. Back then, I self-learned ASP.NET and PHP, CSS, HTML, Javscript, HCI, etc teaching HND and Foundation Degree courses at the City of Wolverhampton College and the University of Wolverhampton having held the youngest lecture accolade too.Fast forward to today, and building full-stack web applications has never been easier! Got me thinking I have not produced a CV in a long time - and I was asked to showcase my experience. Well being self-taught in web I have no certificates. But I have served as an External Examiner (EV) and Internal Verifier (IV)  and OSCA for multiple institutions, including the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University, Kingston University, and University of Surrey (BSc Top-Up programs) and Pearson, NCFE exam boards and written Degree modules. Plus I have worked on Innovate UK government-funded projects, developing websites for businesses and contributing to technology innovation and digital transformation. Today it's important to have certificates...Why Learn Full-Stack Development?🔹 Django Framework – A powerful backend for scalable applications🔹 APIs & Integrations – Connecting systems efficiently🔹 Automated Testing – Ensuring stability and reliability🔹 Persistent Storage – Managing relational and non-relational databases🔹 User Authentication – Securing access with login systems🔹 E-Commerce Functionality – Implementing seamless transactionsThe demand for web application development skills is growing as hashtag#AI and data-driven applications transform industries. Securing a career in this field means staying ahead of the curve.The Future of Work is Digital 💡📌 46% of UK businesses struggle to recruit due to a lack of digital skills (UK Parliament)📌 £47K+ – The average UK software developer salary (Indeed)📌 85 million jobs are at risk of automation (World Economic Forum)At ThirdWaveICT, we build full-stack websites, static websites, and apps, if you're looking for expertise, let’s connect!

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

From building my first website in 1998 for Stow Heath Primary School (thanks to Dave Whyley and Gavin Hawkins) to teaching dynamic web design at Bilston College in 1999, I’ve seen the industry evolve drastically. Back then, I self-learned ASP.NET and PHP, CSS, HTML, Javscript, HCI, etc teaching HND and Foundation Degree courses at the City of Wolverhampton College and the University of Wolverhampton having held the youngest lecture accolade too.Fast forward to today, and building full-stack web applications has never been easier! Got me thinking I have not produced a CV in a long time - and I was asked to showcase my experience. Well being self-taught in web I have no certificates. But I have served as an External Examiner (EV) and Internal Verifier (IV)  and OSCA for multiple institutions, including the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University, Kingston University, and University of Surrey (BSc Top-Up programs) and Pearson, NCFE exam boards and written Degree modules. Plus I have worked on Innovate UK government-funded projects, developing websites for businesses and contributing to technology innovation and digital transformation.

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Jeanné Du PlooyJeanné Du Plooy,,"Admittedly biased - but I would highly recommend Allie for professional opportunities in the software and development space. For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Jeanné Du PlooyJeanné Du Plooy,,"Admittedly biased - but I would highly recommend Allie for professional opportunities in the software and development space. For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Jeanné Du PlooyJeanné Du Plooy,,"Admittedly biased - but I would highly recommend Allie for professional opportunities in the software and development space. For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Jeanné Du PlooyJeanné Du Plooy,,"Admittedly biased - but I would highly recommend Allie for professional opportunities in the software and development space. For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Jeanné Du PlooyJeanné Du Plooy,,"Admittedly biased - but I would highly recommend Allie for professional opportunities in the software and development space. For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur.

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

Sage LalSage Lal,lals@wolvcoll.ac.uk,"Mastering hashtag#FullStackDevelopment with hashtag#Django!Web development has come a long way, and so has my journey with it! From building my first website in 1998 for Stow Heath Primary School (thanks to Dave Whyley and Gavin Hawkins) to teaching dynamic web design at Bilston College in 1999, I’ve seen the industry evolve drastically. Back then, I self-learned ASP.NET and PHP, CSS, HTML, Javscript, HCI, etc teaching HND and Foundation Degree courses at the City of Wolverhampton College and the University of Wolverhampton having held the youngest lecture accolade too.Fast forward to today, and building full-stack web applications has never been easier! Got me thinking I have not produced a CV in a long time - and I was asked to showcase my experience. Well being self-taught in web I have no certificates. But I have served as an External Examiner (EV) and Internal Verifier (IV)  and OSCA for multiple institutions, including the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University, Kingston University, and University of Surrey (BSc Top-Up programs) and Pearson, NCFE exam boards and written Degree modules.

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

From building my first website in 1998 for Stow Heath Primary School (thanks to Dave Whyley and Gavin Hawkins) to teaching dynamic web design at Bilston College in 1999, I’ve seen the industry evolve drastically.

Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Francisco VillagraFrancisco Villagra,,"Interceptores 💡 Me tope con el uso de interceptores en distintos proyectos, y me pareció de suma utilidad.Los interceptores en Entity Framework Core permiten capturar y modificar operaciones de base de datos antes o después de que ocurran. Son ideales para auditar, loguear, o incluso modificar consultas en tiempo de ejecución sin afectar la lógica del repositorio.📌 Cuándo usarlo:✔️ Para registrar consultas lentas o detectar ineficiencias✔️ Implementar lógica de auditoría sin modificar el código del repositorio✔️ Evitar SQL Injection validando consultas antes de ejecutarlasEn mi caso, fue clave para identificar consultas que sobrecargaban la cpu del servidor y que requerian algun rediseño para evitarlo.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interceptors 💡Entity Framework Core interceptors allow you to capture and modify database operations before or after they occur. They are ideal for auditing, logging, or even modifying queries at runtime without affecting repository logic.📌 When to use it:✔️ To log slow queries or detect inefficiencies✔️ Implement audit logic without modifying the repository code✔️ Avoid SQL Injection by validating queries before executing themIn my case, it was key to identifying queries that were overloading the server's CPU and that required some redesign to avoid it.hashtag#Interceptors hashtag#NET hashtag#C hashtag#EntityFramework

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Mödred DubhdrakiMödred Dubhdraki,,"Hello all, today I'd like to shine a light on an often-underutilized feature of C#, Delegates. Delegates, for those unfamiliar, are type-safe functions pointers, a cornerstone concept in C# which enables advanced programming techniques like Events and Callback functions.Now, why would we care about Delegates in C#? Well, they're incredibly helpful in creating highly-componentized and flexible systems. With them, you can parameterize your methods with actions and change those actions dynamically at runtime. But let's not just focus on their technical merits. To truly appreciate their potential, we must venture beyond the code itself to the realm of application.Imagine you're writing a system to customize AI behavior in a game. With delegates, you can alter AI response based on varying parameters, allowing them to react differently each time and maintain a sense of unpredictability for players. Another application is in Web Development. Imagine a system in which you have to respond differently depending on the client request. Delegates can help you accomplish this task by routing requests through various methods.In both these examples, delegates help your code become flexible and maintain the opening for future changes, thus embodying the principle ""Code to an interface, not an implementation"". The power of delegates is not only restricted to reusability and flexibility. When combined with event-driven programming, the reach of delegates extends to improving the efficiency of your program using Asynchronous Programming techniques.But remember, like any tool in programming, delegates come with both benefits and downsides. They indeed add functionality and power to your code, but they also can add complexity if not managed properly. So, the next time you're working on a project, might it be a game developed in Unity or a web application in ASP.NET, don't forget about the humble delegate, ever ready to serve and streamline your programming solutions. As always, happy coding!hashtag#CSharp hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#GameDev hashtag#ProgrammingConcepts

Peter KochPeter Koch,,"When you - as I am - are on a job hunt (or selling to new clients) it is always interesting to see, who will pick up the phone when you give a call to busy senior leaders in busy companies. I must say, that it has been a very positive experience. February has been busy with coffee meetings, and great contacts in the network. Thank you to all coffee meeting participants (leaders and companies) for your advice and time. Also many thanks to all of you who have liked, shared and written comments, called me and provided ideas, leads and support in many other ways (also from colleagues). I have learned that the wider the ""Open for New Opportunities"" LinkedIn post can be shared the better. I have also learned that a personal/physical 1:1 meeting between people is still highly valuableThe ongoing talks have provided me with good memories - and new magic moments  -  when reconnecting with network relations, new business contacts, headhunters and people who I - in some cases - may not have seen for a while. The positive dialogues are much appreciated. Today Partner Bettina Bencke, and Manager Birthe Bülow from Bencke & Partners, who are working with headhunting and recruiting, kindly hosted a coffee meeting in central Copenhagen. Thank you to Birthe Bülow for providing inspiration, professional insights and excellent advice for the continued journey towards the next job, within one of the following areas, as described on my LinkedIn profile:1) General management of business units/teams 2) Project management of multi-disciplinary technology/business projects or business transformations with organisational development3) Business development, clients, sales, tenders and growthOpen for New Opportunities post on LinkedIn:https://lnkd.in/dgVXCwFmFurther info can be found on my LinkedIn profile: ""International business man with strong market, technology and communication skills"". https://lnkd.in/drKa-cFT

For some insight, here is a list of things that make him a great choice!*places glasses on tip of nose reading from clipboard list*Allie;1. Makes up songs at the drop of a hat. While I promise I'm not promoting his mixtape, our daughter is his biggest fan.2. Is a rare linguistic talent in that he frequently mixes idioms and sayings like ""at the drop of a dime"" bastardising ""turns on a dime"" and ""at the drop of a hat"" just to keep things interesting and be sure I'm listening.3. Will disappear into the garage for a few hours and come back having built an actual working machine. 4. Doesn't play video games, he ""plays"" 3dsmax.5. Has an infectious excitement about things he's interested in, to the point where I think I understand some quantum physics theories because he has explained it to me with the patience of a Saint.6. Is the kind of person who meticulously plans and will see any project through from inception to completion - as will always be represented by our terraces and stoep which he insisted on building solo. ""Built with my own hands"" taken and executed quite literally. (I played with the wet cement - once... so technically I helped...👀)More to the point - I know for a fact: Allie is a dedicated colleague, a polymath and a software virtuoso.

Jay JadhavJay Jadhav,,"🚀 Ensuring Data Integrity with Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC 🚀In ASP.NET MVC, ensuring data accuracy is crucial, and Data Annotations provide a simple yet powerful way to validate user input.🔹 What are Data Annotations?Data annotations are attributes in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace that help define validation rules directly in the model class.🔹 Commonly Used Data Annotations:✔️ [Required] – Ensures the field is not empty✔️ [StringLength(50)] – Sets max length of a string✔️ [Range(18, 60)] – Restricts a numeric range✔️ [EmailAddress] – Validates an email format✔️ [RegularExpression(@""\d{10}"")] – Custom pattern validation (e.g., 10-digit phone number)✔️ [Compare(""Password"")] – Ensures passwords match (useful for confirmation fields)🔹 How it Works?When a user submits a form, ModelState.IsValid checks if the data meets the annotation rules. If not, validation messages are displayed to guide the user.🎯 Why Use Data Annotations?✅ Reduces the need for complex server-side validation logic✅ Ensures consistency across application layers✅ Improves maintainability and readabilityHave you used Data Annotations in your projects?

Mitesh BhattMitesh Bhatt,,"The IT industry's relentless focus on profits is leading to catastrophic outcomes. Software Engineers' salaries have stagnated and, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased. This is making IT jobs less attractive to graduates from top engineering colleges. Consequently, Tier 1 and 2 talent are opting out of big IT companies. To remain competitive, IT industries demand advanced coding skills in constantly evolving modern technologies. The coding competency standards required to meet global needs are high. Yet, talent from non-Tier 1 and 2 colleges often struggle to meet these standards, despite comprehensive on-campus training. This has resulted in unprecedented layoffs at entry-level positions after months of in-house training. This issue will prope up repeatedly as learnability reduces with age. IT companies must overhaul their talent acquisition and development strategies to achieve better outcomes. If the current practices persist, the IT industry will face severe consequences very soon.

Mödred DubhdrakiMödred Dubhdraki,,"Hello all, today I'd like to shine a light on an often-underutilized feature of C#, Delegates. Delegates, for those unfamiliar, are type-safe functions pointers, a cornerstone concept in C# which enables advanced programming techniques like Events and Callback functions.Now, why would we care about Delegates in C#? Well, they're incredibly helpful in creating highly-componentized and flexible systems. With them, you can parameterize your methods with actions and change those actions dynamically at runtime. But let's not just focus on their technical merits. To truly appreciate their potential, we must venture beyond the code itself to the realm of application.Imagine you're writing a system to customize AI behavior in a game. With delegates, you can alter AI response based on varying parameters, allowing them to react differently each time and maintain a sense of unpredictability for players. Another application is in Web Development. Imagine a system in which you have to respond differently depending on the client request. Delegates can help you accomplish this task by routing requests through various methods.In both these examples, delegates help your code become flexible and maintain the opening for future changes, thus embodying the principle ""Code to an interface, not an implementation"". The power of delegates is not only restricted to reusability and flexibility. When combined with event-driven programming, the reach of delegates extends to improving the efficiency of your program using Asynchronous Programming techniques.But remember, like any tool in programming, delegates come with both benefits and downsides. They indeed add functionality and power to your code, but they also can add complexity if not managed properly. So, the next time you're working on a project, might it be a game developed in Unity or a web application in ASP.NET, don't forget about the humble delegate, ever ready to serve and streamline your programming solutions. As always, happy coding!hashtag#CSharp hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#GameDev hashtag#ProgrammingConcepts
